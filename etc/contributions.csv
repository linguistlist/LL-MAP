    <description>Outlined on this map are the locations that Ehret hypothesizes gave rise to the Afrasan, Middle Nile, Khoisan and Niger-Congo traditions.  In his book, he describes how each area affected the development of these ancient cultures as well as some of their differences, citing examples such as the Afrasan reliance on wild grass collection for food, and Middle Nile tendency to hunt large game and fish.</description>

    <description>This illustrates Ehret's hypothesis regarding the state of agricultural development in Africa circa 3500 B.C.E.  The main changes that Ehret points out occur within two particular groups, although all were expanding.  As the Cushitic peoples spread west, they began absorbing many former Omotic groups into their societies.  Further across the continent, the West African planting agricultural tradition continued spreading to the belt of western rainforest near the Atlantic coast.</description>

    <description>This map displays the state and distribution of agricultural practices in Africa circa 5500 BCE.  The Omotic culture was slowly being absorbed by expanding Cushitic agripastoralists, while Middle Eastern pastoralists were spreading through the Arabian peninsula to parts of Asia and Europe.  The map African Agriculture ca. 3500 BCE further illustrates Ehret's historical hypothesis regarding the distribution of techniques and peoples in the northern half of the continent (Ehret).</description>

    <description>This map broadly outlines a series of migration paths as described by Bellwood (2006).  He states that the hypothesis best supported by current linguistic and archaeological research is that the proto-Austronesians migrated out of mainland China around 4000 BC and across the Taiwan Strait into Taiwan.  From there, they migrated south through the Philippines, resulting in the formation of the Malayo-Polynesian subgroup.  Over time, they continued to migrate further east and west, and advancements in maritime technology allowed the Austronesians to spread out across the Pacific and Indian oceans, reaching such far-flung locations as Rapa Nui (Easter Island) in the Pacific and Madagascar in the Indian (Bellwood 2006).  This hypothesis is challenged by emerging genetics research, such as Li et al. (2008).</description>

Each period is represented with different color text and can be turned on and off via the ""Active Layers"" tab.Names followed by an asterisk denote islands or regions known as dwelling places of distinct ethnic groups, although it is uncertain whether each ethnic groups is restricted to its given location.

    <description>The languages of Australia are extremely diverse and 
        their origins are relatively obscure. No relationship
        has yet been determined between the languages of
        Australia and those of any other region, excluding a
        number of possible loanwords from Papuan
        languages in northern Australia.
        Relationships between Australian languages
        show that even within the same continent there is
        extreme diversity. This map shows 31 distinct 
        language families in Australia, as well as groups and
        subgroups within those families, where applicable.
        The majority of these language families are located
        in the far northern part of the Northern Territory,
        and do not seem to bear definitive similarities to one
        another, forming a linguistically dense and diverse
        region. The majority of Australia, however, is taken
        up by the large Pama-Nyungan family, which is itself
        diverse, and consists of many subgroups, including
        the large Southwest Group in Western Australia, 
        Southern Australia, and parts of the Northern
        Territory and the Paman Group in north Queensland.</description>

    <description>This map shows the political boundaries of the Austro-Hungarian Empire between 1867, the year of its formation, and 1914. The Hungarian Kingdom included 71 administrative regions called counties. The non-Hungarian part of the Empire, which came to be known as Austria, consisted of 17 provinces, or crownlands.
In 1878 the Habsburgs were granted permission to occupy the Ottoman provinces Bosnia/Bosna and Herzegovina/Hersek, and Austria annexed Bosnia-Herzegovina as a single province in 1908. From 1867-1908 there were also Habsburg troops in the Sanjak (District) of Novi Pazar, a territory between Montenegro and Serbia.
The region labeled Galicia* is believed to belong to the province of Galicia, but it has been given a different shade of blue to reflect the coloration of the original map. No explanation for this distinction has been found.</description>

    <description>The dialects of Slovak are seen to be particularly resilient to change.  They are resilient to the extent that a number of feature variants are considered as simply alternatives within the standard.  The three main dialect groups are indicated in this map according to colour: West Slovak is represented by shades of green; Central Slovak is represented by shades of blue, East Slovak is represented by shades of yellow. Variation in the shades shows the counties of Slovakia.  West Slovak resembles Movarian varieties of Czech in terms of sharing some features.</description>

    <description>This map was created from shapefile data provided by the National Atlas of Canada.
Canada may be divided into six broad Aboriginal cultural areas based on major geographic regions. Tribes in the same region share a greater number of cultural affinities than tribes from different regions. However only in the Arctic do the lines of geography, language and culture coincide so closely. Nunavutâs boundary strongly reflects that of the cultural zone of the Aboriginal people of the Eastern Arctic. The Inuit are descendants of the Thule, who came from Asia and lived in the Arctic for thousands of years. Their language, Inuktitut, is spoken by most of the population.
This map illustrates the six major aboriginal cultural areas of Canada. Notice that the Nunavut boundary closely reflects that of the cultural zone of the people of the Eastern Arctic. The Inuit also live in the northern regions of the Northwest Territories, northern Quebec and Labrador. The spoken language, Inuktitut, is limited to Nordic regions, while the other native cultural areas of Canada are much more heterogeneous.
The Arctic, characterized by its cold environment and scarce resources, has produced a highly specialized culture which was centred primarily on the hunt for seals and other marine mammals in coastal regions and caribou in inland areas west of Hudson Bay. Small, widely dispersed bands of hunters have traditionally followed seasonal migration patterns in search of these prey. (National Atlas of Canada)</description>

    <description>This map outlines the early years of Cushitic spreading and some of the resulting diversity.  In his book, Newman discusses how changes in agriculture lead to the diversification of Cushitic.  Central Cushitic developed among grain cultivators and herders, and when groups migrated south into Tanzania and Kenya, their language became what is now known as southern Cushitic.  Northern Cushitic was located predominantly in the arid lowlands, while the eastern branch was located in the southern rift valleys.  He argues that ensete cultivators, which had once been thought to speak ""western Cushitic"", were most likely Omotic speakers.</description>

        various regions of the Australian
        continent, describing how many Common
        Australian proto-forms have been
        identified as reflexes in Australain
        languages. Assuming that the presence
        of Common Australian vocabulary items
        is evidence for a typological relationship,
        this map can be used as a basis for
        further research into Australian
        historical linguistics, particularly
        when combined with structural information.
        The details of this map reveal that the
        majority of Common Australian reflexes
        are located in the Wati group in the states
        of Western Australia, the Northern Territory,
        and South Australia. The presence of
        reflexes remains high throughout these states
        and is also high among the Wiradjuric family
        of central New South Wales. From these
        families and regions, the presence of
        Common Australian reflexes gradually
        weakens.</description>

    <description>This map illustrates the Huastec route from c. 2000 BC to c. 1000 BC. 
""Proto-Maya, the common ancestor of all Maya tongues, was probably spoken in west-central Guatemala, 
around the highland pine-oak forests of the Cuchumatanes mountain chain: north of the Motagua and Grijalva river valleys, 
through patches of cloud forest, and down to the edge of the tropical forest lowlands near the Ixcán and Chixoy (Negro) rivers, 
which flow into the Usumacinta River (Campbell and Kaufman, p. 191). Evidence that this region was the Maya ""heartland"" include
 its being located near the center of present-day language diversity within the Maya phylum (and therefore requiring the minimum
 number of moves to place the languages in their current locations), the fact that proto-Maya included words for flora and fauna 
 from both highland and lowland areas, and the debatable idea that it is easier for a group of people to spread from a highland 
 region to a lowland one than vice-versa (Dahlin, p. 370). (...)  Whether the proto-Huastecs split from the rest of the Maya in 
 2200 or in 1200 BCE, the separation occurred at least a millennium before the rise of classic Maya culture. (...)
 If we consider 2000 BCE as a reasonable date for the Huastec/Maya split, and the slopes of the Cuchumatanes range as a 
 reasonable location for the speakers of proto-Maya, it seems likely that the split occurred after these proto-Maya speakers 
 (or a portion of them) began to migrate north, probably along the Usumacinta River, and before the two groups resulting from 
 the split began to move in opposite directions: the proto-Huastec speakers moving northwest (and, soon thereafter, 
 the proto-Chicomuceltec west into the Chiapas highlands), and the proto-Yucatec/other Maya-speakers spreading northeast 
 (one branch of which became Chontal, presumed by many from its widespread loan words and hieroglyphic evidence to be the
 dominant language of the classic Peten Maya heartland). While we have no direct archaeological evidence to explain the split 
 itself, we can assume by linguistic evidence that contact was soon cut off between the two groups, despite there being no 
 geographical feature that would automatically isolate them from each other."" (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huastec_people""

To fully expose the myriad forces acting on the many languages of this area would require several maps, but this single presentation skillfully incorporates historical context, language nuclei, and migration and labour trade routes and patterns, sufficient to illustrate the general picture of Tok Pisin's development and rise to prominence. Perhaps most striking is the incredible distance traveled by migrant workers to and from Western Samoa, speaking Samoan Plantation Pidgin, both influencing and being influenced by Tok Pisin.</description>

Additional remarks from the legend: 
Figures for 1964 are derived from <i>Atlas narodov Mira</i> (Moscow 1964), p.20. Figures for Peisan and Azeri include the speakers of all their dialects listed separately in the Atlas. 
Figures for 2006 are extrapolated from similar cases where the society shows comparable rates of fast urbanization, education and wealth generation with more reliable and available data than Iran.
Many more people speak Persian as their first language today than did two generations ago. Heavy migration into the cities, mass education and electronic media have all helped in linguistic assimilation of many an Iranian minority member. While, e.g., around 19% of the Iranians are ethnic Azeris, only around 13% speak Azeri as their first language. Meanwhile, the percentage of those speaking Persian as their first language, may now be not much less than the 68% claimed by the Iranian census of 2001.</description>

This particular map compares the extent of the Dardic family with the linguistic area influenced by it.

Note for reading these maps: The original LSI maps do not indicate boundaries or areas for all languages/dialects. This is why some language/dialect names appear simply as labels, while others appear as areas.

Yue is found primarily in the Pearl River Delta with approximately 28 million speakers, Hakka in the Eastern, Central, and Northern parts with 11.37 million speakers, while Min is distributed along the eastern seaboard and Leizhou Peninsula with 12.2 million speakers. Shaozhou Tuhua is located primarily in the north with 800,000 speakers. Areas where minority languages are spoken are also included on this map.</description>
    <note>The authors note that these figures do no include speakers in sparsely populated or linguistically mixed areas. They also note that areas of one dialect are often interspersed with many small pockets of other dialects (indicated by triangular symbols on the map).

    <description>This map (Daan and Blok, 1969) uniquely presents both production and perception of Dutch dialects, using data collected in 1939.  Like other dialect maps, it displays the different dialects produced, shown by area borders and differing labels, but it also uses the colour spectrum as a tool to represent the perceptions of local speakers. The colours for each area were intuitively selected to represent how similar local speakers thought dialects were in respect to each other; if different areas are similar in colour, this shows that speakers thought the dialects spoken in these areas were similar.  The dutch labels for each dialect area can be checked on as a separate layer on this map.</description>

This particular map shows the speech varieties of the Eastern Hindi language. ""Awadhi spoken by many Musalmans"" is the wording from the original source. Please note that you may need to zoom in from the default view in order to see some language labels.
<p>
Note for reading these maps: The original LSI maps do not indicate boundaries or areas for all languages/dialects. This is why some language/dialect names appear simply as labels, while others appear as areas. That is, these two categories of labels are not meaningfully different (i.e. they do not represent different subgroups or anything similar) unless the legend specifically indicates otherwise.</description>

<p>This particular map shows the dialects of the Marathi language; you may need to zoom in from the default view to see many of the language labels. The original source states that, apart from the geographically distinct Halbi dialect in the east, there are few dialectal differences in the contiguous Marathi area, and ""there is only one real dialect, viz., Konkani. There are, of course, everywhere local varieties, and these are usually honored by a separate name."" Thus, the names within the green ""Marathi"" area on this map may or may not represent speech varieties that differ in a linguistically significant way.</description>

Following Cook's voyage in 1778, reports of good prices for sea otter brought a wave of explorers and traders to the region. Spain and Britain in particular were committed to finding a navigable passage inland. British explorer George Vancouver meticulously surveyed the area before confirming previous Spanish explorers' conclusion that the straits described by Fuca, Fonte, and Maldonado did not exist.

    <description>This map shows the regions affected by the merger between the vowels /i/ and /I/ in American English. Members of the Telsur project interviewed native English speakers across the country and recorded their pronunciations of words such as ""Feel,"" ""Fill,"" ""Hill,"" and ""Heel"" as well as their perception of whether or not minimal pairs were distinct.
<br ?>The study determined that speakers begin to perceive the two sounds as indistinct before they begin merging them in their speech. The study also notes that in Texas and the western states, the more lax /I/ sound has dominated the merger, while in the southern states, the more tense /i/ sound predominates after merging.
Note that the original image does not use correct IPA transcriptions, and that the digitized version has been modified to reflect current IPA standards.</description>

    <description>## Abstract:
      This map layer shows Indian lands of the United States.  Only areas of 640 
      acres or more are included.  Federally-administered lands within a 
      reservation are included for continuity; these may or may not be 
      considered part of the reservation and are simply described with their 
      feature type and the administrating Federal agency.  This is an updated 
      version of the December 2004 map layer.
    ## Purpose:
      These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the 
      national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be 
      displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale 
      data.  No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United 
      States in the use of these data.

    ## National Atlas Process description
        Working in Arc/INFO, Indian reservations and Federal lands internal 
        to them were extracted from the National Atlas Federal Lands map 
        layer.  Isolated features under 640 acres were deleted. Attributes for 
        feature type, name, administering agency, State, and State FIPS codes 
        were retained.  Adjacent Indian reservations having the same feature 
        type, name, and administering agency were merged.  State attributes of 
        merged Indian reservations were then updated.  Names for non-Indian 
        lands were deleted.  For polygons without label points, the points were 
        created and the polygons were assigned a null value. The boundaries from ATLAS_INDLN_200412 were aligned to National Park
        boundaries from ATLAS-FEDLN_200512 as part of a National Parks update to
        ATLAS-FEDLN_200512.  The file was processed as a geodatabase before it
        was converted to a shapefile.</description>

    <description>Shown here are important kingdoms, groups and cities in northern Africa around 1550.  Important details of the period include the fate of the large Songay Empire, the expansion of the kingdom of Morocco and European colonization.  The Songay Empire suffered from internal political turmoil and degenerated into civil war in the 1580s as it collapsed.  Meanwhile, the kingdom of Morocco was growing in power, and steady trade with Europeans provided them with superior weapons, allowing them to expand further as they conquered former Songay lands.  European colonial powers vied for forts and trade agreements along the Atlantic coast, although large settlements were rare (Ehret).</description>

    <description>This map depicts the indigenous languages spoken in Papua New Guinea. The island of Papua New Guinea is split into two countries: Papua New Guinea (eastern) and Indonesia (western). This is a political division, and several Papuan languages are spoken in both areas, which is why a portion of Indonesia is included on this map. 
The largest language family in Papua New Guinea is the Trans-New Guinea language family, represented in red on this map. The next largest are Sepik-Ramu represented as green, and primarily in the north-eastern portion of the country; and the Oceanic subgroup of languages represented in aqua and spoken on the islands and along the coastal areas. Ethnologue states there are currently 841 languages actively spoken in Papua New Guinea, and approximate 11 languages that have died. Amongst these, the Austronesian languages are the most widely spoken.

    <description>The Linguistic Survey of India (LSI) was a survey of the languages of British India, conducted in the first several decades of the 20th century by the British Raj and directed by Irish linguist George A Grierson.
<p>
This particular map shows the extent of the Tibeto-Burman family in India. Note that the northeast boundary of Tibetan and Lolo does not actually indicate the edge of the language area, but just the edge of the data provided on this map.
<p>
On LSI maps of language families, such as this one, it is not always clear or consistent whether names refer to <i>languages</i> or <i>subgroups</i>. In our digitized versions, we have included the maximal language coding possible (i.e. if a name could refer to either a language or a subgroup, we include codes for both).</description>

    <description>Dialects of Italian (not to be confused with the Languages of Italy) are regional varieties of the Italian language, more commonly and more accurately referred to as Regional Italian. The dialects have features, most notably phonological and lexical, percolating from the underlying substrate languages. Tuscan and Central Italian are in some respects not distant from Italian in their linguistic features, due to Italian's history as derived from a somewhat polished form of Florentine. Nevertheless, the traditional speech of Tuscany is rightly viewed as part of the collection of dialects of Italy. Several of the ""dialects of Italy"" should be considered distinct languages in their own right, and are assigned to separate branches on the Romance language family tree by Ethnologue and other academic works.</description>

Please note: The letters correspond to the map's original image. Thus, in this map, A stands for <i>kevgaluk</i>, B stands for <i>iligvak</i> or <i>ilegvak</i>, C stands for <i>kuiguartaq</i>, D stands for <i>tevyuli</i>, and E stands for <i>kanaqlak</i>.  
For the Yup’ik item—<i>Muskrat</i>—Jacobson notes that cognates of <i>kevgaluk</i>&nbsp for ‘muskrat’ occur in other Eskimo languages and are found only in the extreme north and south of Yup’ik. He argues that the occurrence of <i>kevgaluk</i>&nbsp in Egegik not due to the borrowing from the neighbor Alutiiq because Alutiiq has no <i>v</i>&nbsp while the Egegik form does. The author claims that <i>kevgaluk</i>&nbsp is from <i>kevgaq</i> ‘messenger’ and <i>iligvak/ ilegvak</i>&nbsp from <i>ilik</i> ‘helper’, which shows ""a common formative idea”. Like <i>iligvak/ ilegvak</i>, the three rest words exit only in Yup’ik: “<i>kanaqlak</i>&nbsp is related to <i>kanar(te)-</i>&nbsp ‘to bed the head downward as toward the water’ (one can compare this to <i>paluqtaq</i> ‘beaver’ and <i>palur(te)-</i>&nbsp ‘to turn stomach down’); <i>tevyuli</i>&nbsp means ‘one that is good at portaging’;  <i>kuiguartaq</i>&nbsp means ‘thing of the sloughs and ox-bow lakes’”.

    <description>This map comes from a series of individual maps of Yup'ik dialect differences. The distribution maps have been created from survey results completed by bilingual teachers in 61 out of 68 Yup’ik villages. While the respective points may be the same in size, this does not reflect the population density: some villages can have less than fifty speakers while others have populations up to a thousand. 
Please note: The letters correspond to the map's original image. Thus, in this map, A stands for <i>yuk</i>, B stands for <i>cuk</i>, C stands for <i>suk</i>, and D stands for <i>taru</i>.
For the Yup’ik item—<i>Person</i>——Jacobson discusses the two variants of <i>yuk</i>: one is <i>suk</i> in some areas on the Yukon which “is the result of a universal change of initial <i>y</i>&nbsp to voiceless <i>s</i>,” and therefore <i>suk, sukutaq</i>&nbsp ‘moisture’ and <i>saani</i>&nbsp  ‘over there’—corresponding to <i>yuk, yukutq,</i> and <i>yaani</i>&nbsp in most Yup’ik; the other variant is <i>cuk</i>&nbsp in Chevak and Nunivak which is because “these places have initial <i>c</i>&nbsp where other places have <i>y</i> but only when followed by a single vowel”, therefore <i>cuk, cukutaq</i>, but <i>yaani</i> not <i>*caani</i>. In addition, Hooper Bay follows this initial <i>c</i> pattern except for the word <i>yuk</i>. Alutiiq follows the Chevak-Nunivak pattern with <i>s</i> instead of <i>c</i>, and not the Yukon <i>s</i>&nbsp pattern, given <i>suk, sukutaq</i> but <i>yaani</i>&nbsp not <i>*saani</i>. Finally, <i>taru</i>&nbsp is a Alutiiq word.  
The table below shows Non-Yup'ik Languages that also share items of Yup'ik, the letters corresponding to the note above. The ones with an asterisk mean that there is no data found for the language.

    <description>This map displays important groups, empires and cities in Africa circa 100 CE according to Christopher Ehret.  As shown, the Roman Empire controlled a vast territory along the northern coast and the Nile river.  Roman expansion and trade facilitated the transmission of new technologies throughout the continent, especially ironworking.  Other major cultural changes were occurring as well; Christianity began spreading throughout Northern Africa and Aksum was one of the first major kingdoms to convert around 200 years later.</description>

To name a few of the important events of this period, Islamic settlement and continued expansion under differing Caliphates influenced much of the north of the continent, even spreading into modern-day Spain and Portugal.  At the edge of the African continent, the Abbasid Caliphate was deeply involved in several wars, including those against the Byzantine and Omayyad Empires.</description>

    <description>This map depicts areas of Anhui province that are south of the Yangtze river, and the counties along the Wan river. The total area covered is approximately 480,00 sq km with a population of 11 million. Also included in this map are parts of neighboring provinces of Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, and Jiangxi. The composition of dialects spoken here is rather complex; dialects native to Southern Anhui include Wu, Hui, and Gan while others (e.g. Xiang, Min, Hakka, and She) were bought there by waves of migration into the area in the years after 1866. Jianghuai Mandarin has also heavily influenced the dialects spoken in major towns and cities, such as Dangtu, Caishi, Wuhu, and Datong.
         Notes:
<li>The source uses 'Supergroup > Group > Subgroup > Cluster' as their original hierarchy. In our terminology, this is 'Subgroup' > Language > Dialect Group > Dialect' where applicable.

<li>
The term 'Remnants' was not clearly defined in the source, but the author describes Wu as the original language of the Northeastern part of the map before war and plague reduced populations in this area. The language situation there now is the result of subsequent migrations into the area.
</li>
<li>
The term 'Pocket' refers to smaller communities of that language, whereas area features denote larger, more widespread communities.

    <description>This map presents a series of hypothesized migration routes undertaken by Austronesian language speakers stretching back as far as 6000 BP.  In his festschrift, ""Remapping the Austronesian Expansion"", Blench discusses the need to diversify the areas of the world examined in Austronesian studies, and each of the paths represented here are indicative of areas where possible (or documented) links have been established through archaeological, linguistic or biological research (Blench). In the feature info pane for each of the more controversial figures, a brief note has been added regarding the manner of the evidence that Blench cites.  As he states, further study should be taken on in order to verify or invalidate these claims.</description>

    <description>This map depicts the extent of the Mongolian language in China, divided into dialects and subdivided into ""vernaculars"". These divisions reflect those adopted by Chinggeltai (1979) and Dob (1983). The authors write that despite various grammatical and phonological differences, all the pictured dialects are mutually intelligible. Lexically, Bargu-Buriat and Inner Mongolian are very similar, but Oirat differs considerably from the other two. Within each dialect, the vernaculars differ negligibly from one another in terms of grammar, but have some lexical and phonetic differences.</description>

    <description>This map depicts Hua'er festival locations and Deity Renewals. The data point for 'Lao ye' (Old Man) Mountain (in the Northeast of the larger basemap) contains several songs (in .mp3 format) from a festival which takes place in July; these may be found by right clicking on the point to reveal more information.
<i>Excerpt from Hua'er meetings: dialogic song during pilgrimage (full text can be found in 'other LLMAP resources' below):</i
Hua'er (Mandarin Chinese Huā'ér 花儿) is a Pan-Ethnic Chinese-language dialogic song form that is performed largely in spontaneous festivals on holy mountaintops and other sites in Amdo (Northern Tibet). These annual events attract 100-40,000 people from many ethnic groups--the Amdo Tibetans, Muslim and Han Chinese, Salars, and Monguors--and they cluster around the summer solstice.

	These hua'er ""meetings"" 花儿会, as they are known, are concentrated where the loess plains of western China meet the Tibetan plateau in northeastern Tibet, primarily in what is today southern Gansu province and southeastern Qinghai province, but also in Ningxia and Xinjiang.
The first day, or part of the first day, is devoted to prayers for auspicious events: young couples pray for the birth of a son, farmers pray for a lack of crop-destroying hailstorms and a good harvest. Depending on the site, prayers and offerings may be made at Buddhist or Daoist temples both large and small, situated in a choice location at the sacred site. If the sacred site is a mountain, then one or more temples are located at the foot of the mountain, along heavily-travelled paths partway up, and/or at various summits with commanding vistas.

    <description>Chinook Jargon, also known as Chinook Wawa, is a pidgin that draws it’s vocabulary from Nootka, Canadian French, and English.  It is thought that Chinook Jargon originated as a trade language along Pacific coast from Oregon to Alaska.  While an exact date of origin is highly debated many scholars agree that it was widely used in the 19th century.  Chinook Jargon would have made it possible for First Nations peoples, Native Americans and Europeans as well as speakers of other languages to communicate for trade.  This map shows Chinook Jargon placenames that cover the United States and Canada.</description>

    <description>This map illustrates the languages spoken in Borneo. The authors note that Borneo has historically been linguistically diverse, but not necessarily isolated: ""The peoples of Borneo's northern coast were in regular contact with other Austronesians ... on the coast of what is now Vietnam and with China. The Ma'anyan language of southeastern Borneo, moreover, is related to the Malagasy language of Madagascar."" Despite this diversity, however, Malay has been clearly dominant along the coasts since the 15th century, as it has been the main language of both trade and religion (Islam) in the region. <p>Please note that you may need to zoom in to view many of the language labels. In addition, not all subgroup regions contain language labels; we can infer that such subgroups consist of a single language.</description>

    <description>This map comes from a series of individual maps of Yup'ik dialect differences. The distributions maps have been created from survey results completed by bilingual teachers in 61 out of 68 Yup’ik villages. While the respective points may be the same in size, this does not reflect the population density: some villages can have less than fifty speakers while others have populations up to a thousand. 
Please note: The letters correspond to the map's original image. Thus, in this map, A stands for <i>putukuq, maklaaq, maklaar</i>, B stands for <i>angenquq</i>, C stands for <i> angenquyuk</i>, D stands for <i>angunquq </i>, and E stands for <i>angunquyuq</i>. 
For the Yup’ik item—<i>big toe</i>—Jacobson notes that there are two words for big toe: <i>putukug</i>&nbsp is most widespread one and may come from <i>putu-</i>&nbsp  ‘to poke through.’ <i>Angenquq</i>&nbsp  is found in Canineq area of GCY and means ‘the biggest one’ and may be the evidence for the “aglurmiut hypothesis.”

    <description>This map shows the extent of several societies in early South America. 
		During the 15th century, the Inca Empire reached its greatest extent. 
		While a few areas were added later, most of the empire was formed during the reigns of Pachacuti (1438-1463 AD), Tupac Inca (1463-1471 AD and 1471-1493 AD) and Huayna Capac (1493-1525AD) - the sequence of these conquests can be seen in the layer <i>Inca Expansion</i>. 
		The Inca Empire was a patchwork of several different cultures (the original extent of each of these can be seen in the layer <i>Major Cultures in the Late Intermediate Period in Peru</i>). 
		These cultures were overrun in two major phases: first by Pachacuti (see the layer <i>Initial expansion of the Kingdom of Cusco</i>) and then by his son Tupac Inca (see the layer <i>Expansion of the Kingdom of Cusco under Tupac Inca</i>)</description>

    <description>These labels show Ehret's postulated dates regarding the transmission of ironworking practices thoughout the African continent.  He cites current evidence which indicates that while ironworking undoubtedly developed in Anatolia (modern-day Turkey) sometime before 1500 BCE, it must have also been discovered in some areas of sub-Saharan Africa and in the African Great Lakes region independently before 1000 BCE.  Within sub-Saharan Africa, only the Horn of Africa was reached first by Middle Eastern iron technologies, due to the Commercial Revolution and the development of new long-distance trade systems.</description>

    <description>This maps illustrates the locations of various language areas and ethnic groups prominent in Siberia during the 17th Century. According to Stephen A. Wurm, much of the changes in the ethnic and linguistic situation is a result of the expansion of these indigenous groups, notably the Yakuts, the Paleoasiatic Chukchis and to a lesser degree the Evens (Lamuts). It is important to note that the Even ethnic group, believed to be numbered at 7,000 in the middle of the 17th century, dropped to 4,000 people by the end of that same century due to small pox epidemics.</description>

For the Yup’ik item—<i>barrel—</i>Jacobson notes that there are four words for barrel: <i>puckaq</i> and <i>pucuunaq</i> are from Russian, means ‘post’. <i>Napartaq</i> means ‘standing thing’ and ‘post’. <i>qaltaucikaq</i> is what Jacobson called “joint or parallel innovation of Norton Sound Unaliq.""

These islands are in the southern portion of the region, often referred to as 'French Polynesia'. The Austronesian area spans from Madagascar in the west to Hawaii and Easter Island in the east. As it crosses the 180th parallel, this map will need to be viewed as eastern and western sections.

    <description>This map comes from a series of individual maps of Yup'ik dialect differences. The distribution maps have been created from survey results completed by bilingual teachers in 61 out of 68 Yup’ik villages. While the respective points may be the same in size, this does not reflect the population density: some villages can have less than fifty speakers while others have populations up to a thousand. 
Please note: The letters correspond to the map's original image. Thus, in this map, A stands for <i>mik'uq</i>, B stands for <i>miktuq</i>, and C stands for <i>caktuq</i>.  
For the Yup’ik item—<i>(It is) small</i>—Jacobson notes that <i>cak(e)te-</i> is used only in Egegik and <i>mike-/ mik(e)te-</i> elsewhere. He discusses that <i>mik(e)te-</i> is limited to the central coastal area in which the form was more widespread in the past. According to the author, <i>mik(e)te-</i> is used outside of Yup’ik, in Alutiiq, and “within Yup’ik there is a remnant of the <i>t</i> from this base even in <i>mike-</i> areas”.  Finally, he points out “the universal word <i>mikelnguq</i> ‘child’ literally ‘one that is small’"" which is ""built on <i>mik(e)te-</i> and people who use <i>mike-</i> can say <i>mikellruuq</i> for ‘it is smaller' which comes from <i>mik(e)te-</i>"". 
The table below shows Non-Yup'ik Languages that also share items of Yup'ik, the letters corresponding to the note above. The ones with an asterisk mean that there is no data found for the language.

This particular map shows the speech varieties of the Rajasthani language.

Two opposing directions occurred: assimilation regarding voicing goes leftward to give <i>tangerpegnaku</i>&nbsp in the central coast region; elsewhere devoicing goes rightward to give <i>tangerpeknaku</i>&nbsp with voiceless <i>n</i>. Whether the morpheme appears as <i>+pekena-, +pek’na-, +pegna-, or +pekna-</i>, it is an issue regarding “the form of the ‘negative’ subordinative marker as used with consonant ending bases”.</description>

    <description>This maps displays areas of languages and language contacts on both Sakhalin and Kamchatka. It is important to note that after the small pox and influenza epidemics, the number of Itelmens fell from 10,000-12,000 in the 1760s to 1,800 to 1,900 in the 1820s on Kamchatka. The Southern Itelmen language on Kamchatka was the first to become extinct at the end of the 19th century. At approximately the same time on Kamchatka, the Ainu language also became extinct. In regards to the situation on Sakhalin, no more than 100 Ainus remained there at the beginning of 1949. One should note that according to 'Sakhalin Calendar for the year 1898' the Ainu language was primarily spoken on the island by a variety of aboriginal tribes. It wasn't until after the Second World War that massive Russification of the tribal languages took place.</description>

In the accompanying text, the authors explain that the area labeled ""Taiwan Austronesian"" refers to the group of ""Gaoshan"" languages, which include Atayal, Sedeq, Tsou, Kanakanabu, Saaroa, Paiwan, Amis, Bunun, Rukai, Puyuma, Saisiyat, Yami, and Thao. The language coding for this digitized map reflects these.
<p>
Notes: 
-Some language areas that were present in the original image have been left off this map, to prevent confusing overlap with the [Minority Languages of Northern China](ContributionTable#cldf:346160).
-The language areas on this map include disputed territory in Tibet which is also claimed by India, and which overlaps the area considered India in LL-MAP. This is not meant to imply that the map describes the extent of these languages in India - it exclusively depicts language areas within what is, from the perspective of the original mapmakers, China.</description>

exception of Tchifama, which is now mostly Adel&#233-speaking. Pagala-gare and Blitta-carrefour also
have very mixed populations with many Ewe, Kotokoli, and Kabiy&#232 speakers.
The Anyanga are bordered by Kabiy&#232 villages to the east and south. There are also Kabiy&#232 villages

		of Papua New Guinea where the Sam people reside, as well as common travel routes used in the region. This information 
		is part of a larger body of research which examines the relevant cultural, demographic, and geographic aspects while 
		investigating the vitality of the Sam language.</description>

    <description>This map comes from a series of individual maps of Yup'ik dialect differences. The distribution maps have been created from survey results completed by bilingual teachers in 61 out of 68 Yup’ik villages. While the respective points may be the same in size, this does not reflect the population density: some villages can have less than fifty speakers while others have populations up to a thousand. 
Please note: The letters correspond to the map's original image. Thus, in this map, A stands for <i>mamteraq</i>, B stands for <i>qulvarvik</i>, C stands for <i>qulrarvik</i>, D stands for <i>neqipik</i>, E stands for <i>(e)lagyaq</i>, F stands for <i>mayurpik</i>, <i>mayurrvik</i>, and G stands for<i>ellivik</i>. 
For the Yup’ik item—<i>Elevated cache</i>—Jacobson notes that the word <i>mamteraq </i> is found in the Yukon and Norton Sound only, and in the Yup’ik names of Bethel, <i>mamterilleq</i>, and Goodnews Bay, <i>Mamterat</i>. 
<i>Ellivik/ qulvarvik/ qulrarvik</i> literally mean ‘place to put’ or ‘place to put up.’ <i>Neqivik</i>&nbsp is ‘place to process fish’, and <i>(e)lagyaq</i>&nbsp may be from <i>elag-</i>&nbsp ‘to dig’.  Jacobson also notes that this item has inconsistent response from different villages, which raises questions of methodology. 
The table below shows Non-Yup'ik Languages that also share items of Yup'ik, the letters corresponding to the note above. The ones with an asterisk mean that there is no data found for the language.

For the Yup’ik item—<i>Match</i>—Jacobson notes the unusual distribution of the items: <i>(e)spickaq</i>, a Russian loan word, but is found in central coastal area where there was little Russian influence; keneq ‘fire’, a non-loan word, yet is found in upriver Yukon, the upper Kuskokwim and the Nushagak River where there was heavily influenced by Russian. The two Yup'ik forms <i>(e)spickaq</i> and <i>(e)spiickaaq</i> are from the same Russian word <i>spíchka</i>.

For the Yup’ik item—<i>Middle finger</i>—Jacobson notes that <i>qeteqliq</i> is found in Golovin near to the Inupiaq area that uses a cognate, but is surprising to find in upriver Yukon and upper Kuskokim. According to the author, <i>akulipeq</i> and variants is the peripheral GCY (and Alutiiq word) while <i>katneq/qatneq</i> is the core GCY word, and <i>qaquq</i> is a word of central coastal and Canineq areas.

For the Yup’ik item—<i>Moon</i>—Jacobson notes that <i>iraluq</i> and cognates is the most widespread Yup’ik word and found both to the north and south of Yup’ik. <i>Tanqik</i> and cognates is the most widespread word for ‘moon’ in Eskimo and used only in isolated Nunivak within Yup’ik and elsewhere means ‘brightness’. <i>Unugcuun/ unuggsuun</i> (the variation is predictable), literally ‘device for the night’, is the localism and found mostly in Nelson Is. The author argues that this localism is not an old one because of the modern instrumental postbase <i>-cuun/-ssuun</i> that appears to have replaced <i>–(u)n</i> and is now non-productive. He notes that words for ‘pencil’ use both postbase and words for pre-contact device use only the older postbase. Finally, <i>unugcuun</i> means ‘night lamp’, is another device for the night outside Nelson Is.

For the Yup’ik item—<i>Mosquito</i>—Jacobson notes that the Yup’ik word <i>egturyaq/ kegturyaq</i> ‘mosquito’ is used everywhere except in peripheral GCY. He discusses that the deletion of the initial <i>k</i> (except in some divergent dialects) from <i>kegturyaq</i> to give <i>egturyaq</i> is like the pattern in original <i>kenlluni</i> WATER GOING DOWN becomes <i>enlluni</i> in GCY. Finally, the author points out that there are no cognates of the peripheral GCY word <i>makuryaq/ makursaq</i> (the variation is predictable) from other Eskimo even though “the etymology is not shallow (as in the case of <i>panayuli</i>, literally ‘good spearer’ for BUMBLEBEE)"".

For the Yup’ik item—<i>""Mouse"", vole</i>—Jacobson discusses the distribution of the two groups of forms <i>avcellngaq/avelngaq</i> and <i>uugnar/ugnaraq/ugugnaraq</i>&nbsp that illustrate somewhat the coast vs. inland pattern. One can see this through MUSKRAT. While <i>avcellngaq</i>&nbsp and <i>avelngaq</i>&nbsp are unpredictable variants, the other three can be predicted in the places where they are used.

    <description>This map comes from a series of individual maps of Yup'ik dialect differences. The distribution maps have been created from survey results completed by bilingual teachers in 61 out of 68 Yup’ik villages. While the respective points may be the same in size, this does not reflect the population density: some villages can have less than fifty speakers while others have populations up to a thousand. 
Please note: The letters correspond to the map's original image. Thus, in this map, A stands for <i>asaun</i>, B stands for <i>ayaun</i>, C stands for <i>nangneq</i>, and D stands for <i>kumluq</i>.  
For the Yup’ik item—<i>Thumb</i>—Jacobson notes that <i>kumluq</i>&nbsp is the Yup’ik form of an almost pan-Eskimo word for ‘thumb’, and <i>ayaun</i>&nbsp is almost a typical core GCY innovation (compare ELBOW and TONGUE) except for its surprising occurrence (predictably as <i>asaun</i>) in Mt. Village and Norton Sound Unaliq (see also BECAUSE I LEFT). Instead of being derived from the verb base <i>ayag-</i> ‘to leave’, <i>ayaun/ asaun</i> is from the root <i>ayag-</i> that deals with ‘supporting leaning’. <i>Nangneq</i>&nbsp literally ‘the last one’ is found in Nunivak and Chugach Alutiiq which is the evidence of the part of the Aglurmiut hypothesis that links Nunivak and Alutiiq.

    <description>This map depicts places populated by the Salar ethnic group. The Salars are most likely Oğuz-Turkic speakers who migrated from Transoxiana to Amdo Tibet in the 13th century. Settling on the banks of the Yellow River in what is today Qinghai province, they intermarried with Tibetans and later Muslim Chinese, incorporating many elements of these groups into their culture and language. Today, the Salars number over 90,000, but their unwritten language is rapidly giving way to the dominant languages, particularly to Chinese (Dwyer 2000).
The Salars are one of ethnic groups (along with Amdo Tibetans, Muslim Han Chinese, and Monguors) that participate in Hua'er(Mandarin Chinese Huā'ér 花儿), a Pan-Ethnic Chinese-language dialogic song form that is performed largely in spontaneous festivals on holy mountaintops and other sites in Amdo (Northern Tibet). These annual events attract 100-40,000 people.

11648,Reflexes of Proto-Athabaskan Features in Modern Athabaskan Languages (Gary Holton),"Reflexes of Proto-Athabaskan Features in Modern Athabaskan Languages,"
    <description>This work represents the culmination of decades worth of fieldwork by various individuals as well as Dr. Holton's personal fieldwork. The tree-model of language relationships in Athabaskan linguistics can run into difficulties, and so this map shows the ways that the features of Proto-Athabaskan are realized in the various Athabaskan languages.
What follows is an explanation of the data we have up for display:
<p>
<b>Reflexes of proto-Athabaskan stem-intial obstruent series.</b>
<dl>
<dt>A <b>series</b> refers to a set of unaspirated, aspirated, and ejective stops/affricates at the same place of articulation. This set changes as unit historically. Thus, e.g., the series *ts refers to *ts, *tsh, and *ts'</dt>
<dd>*ts --> ts	tth	tl	kw	t?	f	p</dd>
<dd>*ch --> ts	ch	s</dd>				
<dd>*chw --> ts	ch	tr	pf	s</dd>		
<dd>*k --> k	ch	ch-k	tsy	sh</dd>		
<dd>*q  --> q	k</dd>					
<dt><b>Tone</b> refers to whether the language has tone developed from Proto-Athabaskan (PA) constricted syllables</dt>
<dd>tone =  absent, vestigial, present, complex</dd>
<dt><b>Tone Value</b> refers to the pitch which is realized from PA constricted syllables</dt>
<dd>tone value =none, low, high</dd>
<dt><b>-C' zone</b> refers to the degree of reduction of PA stem-final glottalized consonants</dt>
<dd>Zones are marked as 0-4 from least to most reduced</dd>
<dt><b>-CC</b> refers to the preservation of original suffixes in coda clusters</dt>
<dd>-CC is either yes or no, with yes meaning that (some) suffixes are preserved</dd>

    <description>Though the Yukagirs occupied much of the northern Siberia around 1650, a reduction in their area and numbers took place largely because of Chukchi expansion in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In addition, many Yukagirs died from introduced diseases such as smallpox in the eighteenth century. According to Stephen A. Wurm, the Yukagirs had developed writing system composed of symbolic signs until the 19th century. The Yukagirs numbered about 5,000 at the middle of the seventeenth century and dropped to 400 in 19th century.</description>

    <description>The Austronesian Team has released the ©ECAI Digital Language Atlas of the Pacific. The atlas includes the Pacific area, Southeast Asia (apart from Burma), and Madagascar.	Across the Pacific and Indian oceans, the Austronesian speaking people have voyaged for centuries making a network of communication within a linguistic family that became the most extensive in the world prior to European arrival. The cultures were launched from the Western Pacific and the early Austronesian speakers reached islands of further distance apart traveling in lashed and pegged canoes across vast expanses of ocean. The Electronic Cultural Atlas Initiative (ECAI) over the past few years has developed as a group interested in the academic research and international collaboration. The Austronesian projects were proposed by the founder and chairman of ECAI, Lewis Lancaster, at a meeting entitled Austronesian Studies in Taiwan--Retrospective and Prospect (UC Berkeley sponsored with the Shung Ye Museum in 1997). Since then collaborative teams have taken up the idea by researching the possibilities of cultural mapping using a geographic information system (GIS) to integrate the heritage of a place.This project is a model for future language mapping because it combines the generation of a digital version of older printed language maps with the collection of data on contemporary languages areas, and then the use of dynamic (time-enabled) map display techniques capable of showing visually the changes in language boundaries. The work will also give us an opportunity to advance our work on the design and use of gazetteers of language areas. A conventional gazetteer of Austronesian place-names would be supplemented (or complemented) by a directory of languages and dialects with the formal geographical specifications of where they are (or were) spoken at different times. These data would be coupled with map displays such that any combination of data from the gazetteer could be displayed at will. There are plans for a peer-reviewed digital publication in collaboration with the California Digital Library administered by the Office of the President of the University of California.</description>

For example, Ligurian was spoken around the area of Marseilles (Massalia), as is mentioned in the description of the Greek colonization of the area.  Ligurian is thus shown extending to include this area. In the south, the original map shows ""Aeolic"" settlement.  This must be an error, for no Aeolic settlement was made in southern Italy.

    <description>This map comes from a series of individual maps of Yup'ik dialect differences. The distribution maps have been created from survey results completed by bilingual teachers in 61 out of 68 Yup’ik villages. While the respective points may be the same in size, this does not reflect the population density: some villages can have less than fifty speakers while others have populations up to a thousand. 
Please note: The letters correspond to the map's original image. Thus, in this map, A stands for <i>ciivak</i>&nbsp while B stands for <i>ciuvak</i>. C stands for <i>ciivak</i> and D stands for <i>anaririvaq</i>.
For the Yup’ik item—<i>Housefly</i>--Jacobson argues that it is hard to determine whether or not the pronunciation supports the ""Aglurmiut hypothesis"" in Hooper Bay- Chevak & Egegik. The Nunivak word, on the other hand, is most likely related to <i> anair(aq)</i>, which means 'dung fly,' in much of the Yup'ik.
The table below shows Non-Yup'ik Languages that also share items of Yup'ik, the letters corresponding to the note above. The ones with an asterisk mean that there is no data found for the language.

    <description>The most frequently used climate classification map is that ofWladimir Köppen, presented in its latest version
		1961 by Rudolf Geiger. A huge number of climate studies and subsequent publications adopted this or a
		former release of the Köppen-Geiger map. While the climate classification concept has been widely applied
		to a broad range of topics in climate and climate change research as well as in physical geography, hydrology,
		agriculture, biology and educational aspects, a well-documented update of the world climate classification
		map is still missing. Based on recent data sets from the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) of the University of
		East Anglia and the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) at the German Weather Service, we
		present here a new digital Köppen-Geiger world map on climate classification, valid for the second half of
		the 20th century.

For the Yup’ik item—<i>Taqukaq (meaning)</i> —Jacobson notes that <i>taqukaq</i> means “different things in different place”. It is unclear within Yup’ik which one the original meaning was, but the use for ‘bear’ in Alutiiq suggests that the ‘seal’ meaning is an innovation of the central coastal area. Walrus is another innovation in the area.

For the Yup’ik item—<i>Sweeping it</i>—Jacobson notes the Aleut loan verb <i>kagi-</i> and its unusual borrowing because only nouns are borrowed, and it has spread throughout Yup’ik and Alutiiq. One can see a similar case on SLEEVE. The non-loan <i>canir-</i> is an “exclusion of <i>kagi-</i> only in Norton Sound Unaliq and Nunivak,” but it does occur as an alternative to <i>kagi-</i> sporadically throughout Yup’ik.

The distribution maps have been created from survey results completed by bilingual teachers in 61 out of 68 Yup’ik villages. While the respective points may be the same in size, this does not reflect the population density: some villages can have less than fifty speakers while others have populations up to a thousand. 
Please note: The letters correspond to the map's original image. Thus, in this map, A stands for <i>kenlluni&nbsp</i> while B stands for <i>enlluni</i>.
For the Yup’ik item—<i>Water going down</i>—According to the comparative considerations Jacobson notes that the original form of the verb base in Yup’ik was <i>kente-</i>&nbsp in three out of four divergent dialects. The <i>k</i>&nbsp has been deleted to give <i>ente-</i> in most Yup’ik, and similar bases are <i>kenir-/ enir</i> ‘to point’, <i>kenuur-/ enuur-</i> &nbsp‘to push a little’, and <i>kenegte-/ (e)negte-</i> &nbsp‘to press down on’. One can compare this to the initial <i>n</i>&nbsp in certain areas for BONE and LAUGHING and also see Jacobson 1984a  p.34 for these initial <i>k</i>’s and <i>n</i>’s.

For the Yup’ik item—<i>Tea & sugar</i>—Jacobson notes the map describing the <i>s</i> or <i>ch</i> sounds borrowed from Russian. ‘Tea’ is <i>chay</i> and ‘sugar’ <i>sа́khar</i> in Russian. Both Russian sounds become <i>s</i> in Yup’ik in places where one uses <i>saayuq</i> and <i>saarralaq</i>; both become <i>c</i> in Yup’ik in other areas where one says <i>caayuq</i> and <i>caarralaq</i>. The Russian original is followed in certain areas where one says <i>caayuq</i> and <i>saarralaq</i> because they have great Russian influence around Russian Mission on the Yukon, the upper Kuskokwim and the Nushagak River and Lake Iliamna areas. The author suggests that no area would go against the original Russian to use <i>saayuq</i> but <i>caarralaq</i>.

    <description>This map comes from a series of individual maps of Yup'ik dialect differences. The distribution maps have been created from survey results completed by bilingual teachers in 61 out of 68 Yup’ik villages. While the respective points may be the same in size, this does not reflect the population density: some villages can have less than fifty speakers while others have populations up to a thousand. 
Please note: The letters correspond to the map's original image. Thus, in this map, A stands for <i>ulu/uluq</i> and B stands for <i>alungun</i>.  
For the Yup’ik item—<i>Tongue</i>—Jacobson notes that items illustrates a core GCY innovation. Like a number of body part words replaced in core GCY with descriptive terms, <i>alungun</i> (literally ‘device for lapping’) replaces the pan-Yup’ik word for tongue <i>ulu(q)</i> (see ELBOW, THUMB, HAND, PARKA RUFF, and THIMBLE). The author suggests that <i>alungun</i> is such a natural word that its cognates are used in the Diomedes and in East Greenland (an independent development). In peripheral GCY and non-GCY Yup’ik where <i>ulu(q)</i> is ‘tongue’, and <i>alungun</i> refers to ‘dog-feeding trough’ which is also a device for lapping. 
The table below shows Non-Yup'ik Languages that also share items of Yup'ik, the letters corresponding to the note above. The ones with an asterisk mean that there is no data found for the language.

    <description>This map primarily illustrates Bantu origins and dispersals. It also shows the expansion patterns of both the Central Sudanic and Ubangian people. Newman suggests two reasons for some Bantu moving eastward: 1) food-producing sites might have been lacking and/or 2) the Bantu were moving due to the expansion of Ubangian peoples. 

Newman also talks about how expansions affected multiple groups positively. For example, Ubangians learned about grain cultivation from Central Sudanic farmers along their northern boundary, enabling them to colonize both moist and dry woodland habitats. They reached their maximum geographic range 2,000 years ago.</description>

    <description>Though the Yukagirs occupied much of the northern Siberia around 1650, a reduction in their area and numbers took place largely because of Chukchi expansion in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In addition, many Yukagirs died from introduced diseases such as smallpox in the eighteenth century. According to Stephen A. Wurm, the Yukagirs had developed writing system composed of symbolic signs until the 19th century. The Yukagirs numbered about 5,000 at the middle of the seventeenth century and dropped to 400 in 19th century.</description>

Because the speakers are from relatively close villages and speak the same dialect, we see overlap in placename use.

The island of Borneo is made up of 3 countries: Malaysia (the northern portion), Indonesia (the southern portion) and Brunei (2 areas along the northwestern coast). Languages from many subgroups of the Austronesian languages families are represented, including Malayo-Polynesian, North Borneo and Sulawesi. In addition, Malagasy, the family of languages spoken on Madagascar is believed to have spread from the languages spoke in Southern Borneo.

Roger Blench cites Serge Bahuchet who argues that they may have once spoken a language unique from those of their surrounding groups, but that over time, they absorbed the surrounding languages due to the relationships formed with the incoming Bantu cultivators.  This information is part of a larger work which describes the history and current status of various language groups throughout the continent in order to reconstruct the African past.</description>

The points indicate archeological sites where skeletal remains belonging to the San have been discovered and identified.  This demonstrates the gradual condensing of the population over time due to a variety of factors.
		The San are a diverse group currently located in southern Africa, also known as ""Bushmen"", although this term is seen as racist and sexist.  Their society was traditionally a hunter-gatherer one, however this is slowly changing now with some governments enforcing modernization programs aimed at integrating the San with the more popular cultures of their areas (Nurse, Weiner and Jenkins, 1985).</description>

This name is the word in Lesotho which refers to the same event as the Mfecane.  During this period, the Zulu/Mtetwa state system rose in power and began military expansion.  Consolidation was common for most groups, although some fled (see the Kololo migration route) and others chose to reciprocate military action, resulting in the circular path of the Taung of Mentatisi (Nurse, Weiner and Jenkins, 1985).</description>

    <description>This map displays the main routes of dispersal of Nguni peoples during the Mfecane (1815-1840).  This Zulu name of the period can be loosely translated as ""the crushing"" or ""the scattering"", and is an apt description for what the Nguni peoples did.  It came to pass primarily due to the military pressure from the rising Zulu/Mtetwa militarist state system, the consolidation of the Swati and the defeat of the Ndwandwe military power.  (Note: although lines may intersect, the groups may not have actually met.  The exception to this is the Maseko Ngoni, who fought with Shoshangane's people, the Jele Ngoni, the Rowzi and the Kololo/Lozi.) (Nurse, Weiner and Jenkins, 1985).</description>

    <description>This map illustrates the later locations and migrations of several African language groups, including the Semitic, Bantu, Nilotic, Berber, Afroasiatic and Chadic speakers, as discussed by Roger Blench.  Combined with his map entitled ""The Early Dispersal of Afroasiatic"", it presents a model which explains the distribution of Afroasiatic languages prior to the Arabic expansion beginning in the seventh century.  Two of the languages indicated, Guanche and Elamitic, are extinct; Blench notes that the arrow marking the latter's progress is very uncertain.</description>

    <description>This map illustrates the Inter-Saharan Hypothesis proposed by Roger Blench. This model emphasizes that the common agripastoral vocabulary shared by Cushitic pastoralists and Chadic speakers, along with the widespread archeological evidence of Cushitic migrations, explains their influence on the Afroasiatic language family.  It differs from other postulations surrounding Afroasiatic because it focuses on east to west movement and its consequences, rather than exclusively on those which stemmed from North Africa and moved south, for which much more evidence is documented.</description>

    <description>This map depicts the Native American Culture Areas in North America and is divided into ten regions spanning from Mexico in the south into Northern Canada in the north. Tribes in a given geographic area shared a broad range of cultural traits. Anthropologists consequently divided Native Americans into geographically defined areas. This classification provides a framework for understanding the movements and settlement patterns of the diverse Native American Tribes throughout the Formative Period. These cultural areas are not exact, as they were no fixed boundaries between regions. Often there were considerable cultural similarities among different arreas, or significant differences between tribes in the same area. Anthropologists have devised various schemes for determining cultural areas. The ten culture areas represent the most commonly used system (Flanders, 1998:13).</description>

    <description>This map comes from a series of individual maps of Yup'ik dialect differences. The distributions maps have been created from survey results completed by bilingual teachers in 61 out of 68 Yup’ik villages. While the respective points may be the same in size, this does not reflect the population density: some villages can have less than fifty speakers while others have populations up to a thousand. 
Please note: The letters correspond to the map's original image. Thus, in this map, A stands for <i>ayagnginanemni</i> while B stands for <i>ayainanemni</i>. 
For the Yup’ik item—<i>While I was going</i>—Jacobson discusses the suffixation pattern that used with the 2nd contemporative mood. The marker is <i>+nginaner-</i>&nbsp in the pattern of ayagnginanemni, while the marker is <i>(ng)inaner-</i>&nbsp in the pattern of <i>ayainanemni</i>. The author suggests that people follow the first pattern would also say <i>kaiginanemni</i>&nbsp for ‘while I was hungry’ and <i>qanrinanemni </i>&nbsp for ‘while I was speaking’, while those who follow the second pattern would use <i>kaignginanemni</i>&nbsp and <i>qanernginanemni</i>&nbsp for the same. The distribution follows the common theme of  core GCY vs. peripheral GCY plus divergent dialects. BECAUSE I LEFT has the same distribution.

    <description>During the first half of the first millenium A.D., the Southern Nilotes gradually replaced the Southern Cushites as the dominant group in the outlined area of Africa.  Over the centuries, one tribe of Nilotes became those now known as the Kalenjin.  Christopher Ehret states that their presence is evident in the Southern Nilotic loanwords which remain in Bantu and Eastern Nilotic languages, as well as Tepeth and Yaaku.  These Kalenjin ancestors came to control much of what is now Kenya and the plains of central Uganda, and their contact with Cushites and other groups has resulted in their language being rich with loanwords, especially in areas such as agriculture.</description>

    <description>In his book Southern Nilotic History, Christopher Ehret discusses a number of possible settlements and linguistic interactions of the Dadog of the Masai.  He uses loanword evidence to support his hypothesis that they expanded mainly southward, eventually living as far south as central Masailand.  They influenced many peoples that they encountered; the linguistic affects seen in Sonjo are particularly strong, and Ehret suggests that this may indicate that the Sonjo live in much the same way and location today as they did in the past.</description>

    <description>The division of the proto-Kalenjin community began early in the second millenium, and this separation resulted in the large dialectal variation seen among Kalenjin languages today (Ehret).  Illustrated on this map are the areas which several specific proto-groups inhabited around 1400-1500.  Ehret reconstructs this past by using information gained from the study of their modern descendants, including both cultural and linguistic details.  An example of this investigation is his research into musical instruments; he points out that the drum, although rare among Southern Nilotic peoples, does not have a term in proto-Kalenjin that is known, and this indicates the possibility that drums were introduced to a descendant group.</description>

    <description>This map illustrates the approximate locations of the proto-Kalenjin people and their neighbors.  These descendants of the Southern Nilotes were closely related to the Kitoki (known also as Bukusu or Yumbu), and shared many cultural as well as linguistic aspects.  The proto-Kalenjin (and now, modern Kalenjin) economy was centered around grain cultivation and the raising of livestock, and their societal structure has remained relatively unchanged over the centuries (Ehret).</description>

    <description>This map illustrates the culture areas of the Proto-Southern Nilotes and their neighbors. Ehret argues that there is linguistic evidence to support the location of these communities. Since all attested Southern Nilotic languages of more northerly areas in later times show the defining sound change of proto-Southern Nilotic -- the loss of [r] before [i] in word-final syllables -- it is probable that the dialect or dialects of ancestral to proto-Southern Nilotic were spoken by people living North of the belt between Kilimanjaro and Lake Victoria. Ehret claims that the numerous Southern Nilotic loanwords sugggest the Victoria pre-Southern Nilotic population lived in the areas east and southeast from Lake Victoria. Several loanswords from pre-Southern Nilotic can also be distinguished in Bantu languages.</description>

    <description>This map comes from a series of individual maps of Yup'ik dialect differences. The distribution maps have been created from survey results completed by bilingual teachers in 61 out of 68 Yup’ik villages. While the respective points may be the same in size, this does not reflect the population density: some villages can have less than fifty speakers while others have populations up to a thousand. 
Please note: The letters correspond to the map's original image. Thus, in this map, A stands for <i>massiinaq</i>, B stands for <i>elliqeryaraq</i>, C stands for <i>levaaq</i>, and D stands for <i>kaassalinaq</i>
For the Yup’ik item—<i>Outboard motor</i>—Jacobson notes that <i>levaaq</i>&nbsp refers to the noise of a motor, and <i>elliqeryaraq</i>&nbsp means ‘a way to just put it’ and refers to the ease of putting an outboard motor on a boat. <i>Elliqeryaraq</i>&nbsp is a recently coined word yet widespread except in the geographical center of Yup’ik along the Kuskokwim where the most villages use two or three of other words. According to the author, <i>kaassalinaq</i>&nbsp is from English and <i>massiinaq</i>&nbsp may be from Russian and reinforced by English later on and is also used for ‘sewing machine’.

For the Yup’ik item—<i>Pintail duck</i>—Jacobson notes that several words for ‘pintail’ are reported from widely scattered areas; <i>iyukaq</i> is used in Chevak, Stony River and Levelock, <i>tit'assiq</i> occurs in Unalakleet and Ekwok, and <i>uqulkataq</i> in Newtok and Portage Creek. However, the author suggests that this needs to be checked further. The most widespread word <i>uqsuqaq</i> (from <i>uqsuq</i>), is a word for HEAD restricted to upriver Yukon, the upper Kuskowim and the Lake Iliamna areas. <i>Uutkaaq</i> is from Russian, which is rare because the animal is native to the area.

    <description>According to James L. Newman, the interior of East Africa is one of the most complex ethnolinguistic regions on the continent due to the continuous movement of groups, including Khoisan, Cushitic, Nilotic and Bantu peoples. Bantu advancement, as shown on this map, disrupted the groups that had already settled in these areas and continued until the seventeenth century. The displacement of the previous inhabitants was not complete, however; two Khoisan groups (the Hadza and the Sandawe) along with some Southern Cushites remained in Tanzania (Newman).</description>

Newman, the interior of East Africa is one of the most complex ethnolinguistic regions on the continent, due to the continuous movement of groups, including Khoisan, Cushitic, Nilotic and Bantu peoples.  This map shows the earliest migrations through the area.  They began with the Southern Cushites approximately 5,000 years ago; around 1000 BC, the Eastern Cushites made their way south.  One of the Eastern Cushite groups, the Baz, gave the Southern Nilotes livestock-raising techniques adapted to semi-arid conditions along with several cultural practices, such as a prohibition against eating fish (Newman).</description>

Newman, the interior of East Africa is one of the most complex ethnolinguistic regions on the continent, due to the continuous movement of groups, including Khoisan, Cushitic, Nilotic and Bantu peoples.  As he states in his book, the most influential migrations were those of the Eastern Nilotes.  Despite the characterization of their encounters with other cultures as hostile and often violent, it was more common for groups to be gradually displaced or absorbed, with some maintaining independence and coexisting.  Such was the case with the Southern Cushites, who were displaced over time, and the Kalenjins, who were assimilated into Bantu society (Newman).</description>

    <description>According to James L. Newman, the interior of East Africa is one of the most complex ethnolinguistic regions on the continent, due to the continuous movement of groups, including Khoisan, Cushitic, Nilotic and Bantu peoples.  During the nineteenth century, two major events brought change once again to east Africa: the arrival of the Ngoni and the growth of the trade industries from the coast.  The Ngoni fought their way north, and many peoples fled, were destroyed or were assimilated; some stood their ground, however, and the constant turmoil that resulted prevented population increases for the rest of the century.  By contrast, the steadily improving trade markets encouraged expansion.  Arab-Swahili, Kamba and Yao traders connected the interior of the continent with the coast (Newman 1995: 175).  However, during this era, no states as prosperous or powerful as those in the interlacustrine region would arise (Newman).</description>

    <description>The Mali Empire (Manding: Nyeni;[4] English: Niani), also historically referred to as the Manden Kurufaba[1] was a West African empire of the Mandinka from c. 1230 to c. 1600. The empire was founded by Sundiata Keita and became renowned for the wealth of its rulers, especially Mansa Musa I. The Mali Empire had many profound cultural influences on West Africa, allowing the spread of its language, laws and customs along the Niger River. It extended over a large area and consisted of numerous vassal kingdoms and provinces.</description>

    <description>This map highlights the geographic features and peoples that influenced the development of southern Africa.  The Khoikhoi herders and Bantu cultivators migrated along the route shown, forcing the San to shift a little farther north.  Despite this displacement, these groups coexisted for some time, until the arrival of European settlers pressured them to move north again.  With this reversal of directions, the Europeans created a wave of migration; the resulting clashes between the Europeans and the Bantu and multiple Bantu groups affected populations as far north as Tanzania (Newman 1995: 184-186).</description>

    <description>This map shows four regional genetic populations from which virtually all Africans descended. According to Newman, these populations had formed by the close of the late Stone Age. In addition to finding capoid remains in conjunction with the Nachikufan and Wilton industries, archeologists have also unearthed thirty three skeletons in Southern Zambia. In the Northern region of Africa, skeletal remains demonstrate that Cro-Magnon precursors to modern Mediterranean causaoids inhabited the area from the Lower Nile into the Maghrib. Although skeletons of tall negroids are few, those that exist exihibit characteristics of the sedentarizing lakeside and riverside peoples of the Sahara, the Sahel, the Middle Nile and Eastern Africa. No one has yet discovered definitive Late Stone Age pygmoid skeletons; however,  surviving groups have often been described as exhibiting ""ultra-African"" genetic  characteristics of antiquity, dating as far back as 20,000 years.</description>

    <description>The areas pictured display locations of where Wamo-Chapakúran languages were spoken when they were first encountered and knowledge of them was recorded. As specified in Asher and Moseley, the time of contact varied for each language; most of the coastal languages were first identified during the 16th and 17th centuries, although some languages in the interior of South America became known much more recently during the 20th century (Kaufman 2007).</description>

    <description>This map shows the movement of western Tibeto-Burman peoples from Sichuan (>11500-2000 BCE) into the Brahmaputra basin and surrounding areas (?7000-2000 BCE), bringing with them what would become known to archaelogists as Indian Eastern Neolithic technologies. van Driem argues that these technological advancements may have drawn Sinic language speakers, and linguistic features, to the latter region.</description>

    <description>On this map, large language groups in southern Africa circa 1500 are shown, along with the names of some of the different groups that comprised them.  Archaeological evidence from the cities located on the map indicate that throughout this period trade and conquest had resulted in most groups becoming acquainted with Europeans (especially the Portuguese), and these foreign contacts greatly influenced the fate of most of these language group-states; for example, European trade with the Khoikhoi resulted in the decline of the Herero state, and colonial tactics of turning groups against one another saw to the fall of several other important powers (Newman 1995: 186-188).</description>

    <description>As shown by Newman, this map shows the locations of the various empires in Western Sudan between the ninth and sixteenth centuries. Newman notes that the first polity to gain prominence was Ghana, which did so by trading. Historians do not know for sure, however, what caused Ghana's decline.
Since Mali surrounded an area of agricultural lands and controlled routes to the goldfields, Mali was able to overthrow Soso in the 1330s. The Mali Empire continued to expand, but internal factionalism during the latter half of the fourteenth century contributed to its decline. 
The Songhai took possession of Timbuktu and Djenne and then drove out the Mossi. After obtaining a considerable amount of wealth, battles over royal sucession during the sixteenth century and a Moroccan invasion contributed to the decline of the Songhai military empire.</description>

    <description>Illustrated on this map, migration paths of several important groups, Arab and otherwise, are shown in relation to ethnic groups, cities and important military victories.  In his discussion of the process by which Arabization took place, Newman emphasizes the diffusion of Arab culture from large cities to smaller towns and rural areas and the speed with which this occurred; Arabic replaced Greek and Coptic for writing and speaking in less than 300 years.  This is not to suggest that Islam spread at a similar pace, however.  It was not until the Fatamid dynasty that considerable pressure and threat of economic loss was used to encourage conversion (Newman 1995: 77-80).</description>

    <description>The realization of Polish nasal vowels is associated with extensive variation. One of the most common processes heard in contemporary speech is the decomposition of nasals. This map presents the distribution of several decomposed variants of the front and back nasal vowels. Specifically, it maps the decomposition of the front nasal into /en/ and /ej/ before spirants, and into /em/ word-finally. Additionally, it presents areas where the back nasal is decomposed word-finally only in nouns, adjectives, pronouns, and numerals, as well as areas where it is also decomposed word-finally in verbs.</description>

    <description>This map shows the distribution and dispersal of the languages of the Metis. The term Metis is used for several of the languages spoken by the Metis ethnic group, who number about 100,000 and live mostly in the prairies in the Canadian provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and the Northwest Territories; North Dakota, and Montana in the United States. Since many Metis were nomads, they can also be found as far south as the Grand Ronde Reservation in Oregon. In spite of their lack of a common language, the Metis do indeed form an ethnic group. Part of their shared history is the fact that they centered in the early 1800s around the Red River Settlement which is close to present day Winnipeg (Bakker and Papen, 1996).</description>

    <description>This map reflects two contrasting scholarly hypotheses regarding migration paths and the settlement of the Philippines.  The first hypothesis states that Austronesian migrants traveled south from Taiwan through the archipelago before continuing further south through Oceania, west to Madagascar and east toward Polynesia, Rapa Nui and Hawaii.  The second, offered as an alternative by Delfin et al. (2010), states that while some groups from Taiwan clearly moved south to populate areas of the Philippines, most of the genetic affiliations observed for those living in the southern islands of the chain are shared between the majority of East Asians.  This suggests that additional populations moving from East Asia are quite likely, although further analysis on more genes would be necessary to fully support the conclusion (this study focused exclusively on the Y-chromosome).  
Focusing upon the Negrito populations of the Philippines in order to determine their origins, Delfin et al. (2010) provides strong evidence that Negrito and non-Negrito groups in the Philippines share ancestry and were likely part of the same migration, rather than Negrito populations being descendants of aboriginal peoples present at the time of Austronesian settlement.  They also observed in their study that some of the Negrito groups studied appear to share lineage with several Australian aboriginal groups, and these connections are noted on the map.</description>

    <description>This map outlines expansion routes hypothesized by Li et al. (2008) based on genetic analysis of Y chromosome data gathered from 64 populations (30 Daic, 23 Island Southeast Asian and 11 Taiwan aboriginal).   Their study found that both the Taiwan and Island Southeast Asian populations were more closely related to Daic than to one another, indicating that Daic is likely the ancestral group from which the others derived separate paternal lineages.  This conclusion casts doubt upon the hypothesis put forth by many historical linguists that Austronesian populations arrived at their current locations by migrating south through Taiwan; none of the haplogroup data analysed suggests that these two populations are related more closely to one another than they are to Daic, despite the linguistic similarity observed amongst speakers.  This proposal is inconsistent with current historical linguistic hypotheses, such as those shown on the maps below.</description>

    <description>This map shows probable migration routes for several east Asian population groups as determined by genetic analysis.  In addition to determining that genetic ancestry and linguistic affiliations were closely correlated, the HUGO Pan-Asian Consortium discovered that, ""more than 90% of East Asian haplotypes could be found in either Southeast Asian or Central-South Asian populations [...] with haplotype diversity decreasing from south to north,"" (The HUGO Pan-Asian SNP Consortium 2009).  This suggests that southeastern Asia has a higher degree of genetic diversity than the northeast.  This in turn provides evidence toward the conclusion that modern East Asian populations are at least in part descended from groups that lived in this southern area.     Furthermore, these results suggest that the two-wave hypothesis for the settlement of southeast Asia and the Pacific is not accurate.  Although they state that further studies should be undertaken for verification, their current findings point toward a shared ancestry and a migration history that, ""unites the
Negrito and non-Negrito populations of Southeast
and East Asia via a single primary wave of entry
of humans into the continent,"" (The HUGO Pan-Asian SNP Consortium 2009: 1545).</description>

    <description>This map illustrates the major families of indigenous languages in South America during Pre-Columbian times. Macro-Chibchan and Arawak are the major language families in lower Central America. In particular, Macro-Chibchan speakers dominated the area from Nicaragua through Panama to coastal Columbia and Venezuela (which is called circum-Caribbean groups). The Arawak had long dominated the Greater Antilles, however, in the late period before Conquest, Arawak was threatened by the Carib from northeastern South America. Furthermore, within a century of the Spanish arrival, the number of Arawak decreased due to Spanish aggression and diseases brought from Spain. The Amazon Basin is the area of influx of many peoples, thus many languages such as Arawakan and Carib are spoken in the area. Quechua, the official language was the lingua franca of Inca Empire. The Inca Empire spread from Cuzco, in the southern highlands, down into Chile and northwest Argentina and up through Ecuador.  (See Coe et. al 1986)</description>

    <description>According to the 2006 New Zealand Census:
• 87.0 percent of Maori people lived in the North Island and 24.3 percent lived in the Auckland Region as of 2006.
• Since the 2001 New Zealand census, an increase of 8,580 people have been recognized in the South Island. This has resulted in a population density of 73,230 as of 2006.
• The highest distribution of Maori is identified in four major areas. 64.4 percent of Māori occupy the Chatham Islands Territory, 61.1 percent occupy the Kawerau district, 60.7 percent occupy the Wairoa district, and 59.3 percent live in the Opotiki district.
• In 2006, 84.4 percent of Māori living in New Zealand occupied urban areas, compared to a 1956 demographic which states that approximately two-thirds of this ethnic group occupied rural territories in the mid 20th century.
Note: The Māori ethnic population includes those people who stated Māori as being their sole ethnic group or one of several ethnic groups.</description>

    <description>The -s- (and -z-) aspiration is considered one of the 2 key dialectal markers for Spanish, along with /s/ and /z/ distinction. In fact, there seems to be a relationship between both characteristics. Though the map reflects isolated cases of -s- aspiration in northern Spain, it's likely that they stem from some kind of contact with southern speakers. For most northern speakers, the -s- aspiration was a pretty sure way to detect a southerner. Today the -s- aspirating variety of the language is expanding quickly to the north in Spain.
The words registered in the ALPI surveys that have been used in this map are :
desbocado (ALPI map 65)

Metropolitan Area (Oakland, Macomb and Wayne counties in southeast Michigan). The maps are based on data from the 2000 US Census. 
The census data had to be split in two groups: one for individual languages, and one to include the various groupings done in the 
census summaries. Most of the data for individual languages are available on the tract level.

    <description>This is a compilation of six different maps showing various language locations and tribal groups in the Australia region.
		The Wargamay map displays the Wargamay language and its dialects as well as the neighboring languages. 
		According to Dixon, Wargamay, Hinchinbrook Biyay, and Halifax Biyay are all dialects of the Wargamay language. 
		He also explains that there are strong similarities between Wargamay and the bordering languages of Giramay and Nyawaygi,
		but these similarities do not suggest a ""close genetic connection"" (Dixon).
		The dialectal boundary between Biyay and Halifax Biyay are based loosely on information provided by the source. 
		The Watjarri map illustrates the Watjarri language, ""spoken by the descendants of an Aboriginal tribe previously 
		camped along a section of the Murchison River,"" and its respective neighboring languages and place names (Douglas). 
		Around these stations and towns, within the original Watjarri area, were formed dialects. Furthermore, the railway 
		allowed for influences from other surrounding languages which Douglas describes is evident in the borrowings across 
		vocabularies. The Tasmania map shows a speculative inference of the different locations of the languages and dialects 
		of Tasmania which are now extinct. 
		On the map are 15 regions to which vocabulary are assigned and cross-compared to 
		analyze the genetic relationship between the languages. Crowley and Dixon suggest that there were at least eight languages 
		within Tasmania; however, this conclusion is ""tentative"" as little data is available on many of the languages. The 
		Margany/Gunya map displays Margany and Gunya, ""the south-westernmost of the long chain of closely related dialects known 
		to (...) linguists as the Mari languages"" and other surrounding languages and place names (Breen). The Anguthimiri map 
		highlights the area of Anguthimri speaking groups as well as neighboring peoples and languages. According to Crowley, 
		Anguthimri has ""one of the most unusual phonological systems"" consisting of single-syllable words, consonant clustered
		initial syllables, and an extensive vowel system (Crowley).</description>

    <description>This map shows the Northern Iroquois territory from c. 1000 and the consolidated Iroquois settlements from c. 1500. The Northern Iroquois around 1000 CE were distributed over Western Pennsylvania, New York and Southern Canada from the Upper Lawrence River to Lake Huron. In the following centuries the scattered Iroquois settlements contracted into thirteen tribal areas. This consolidation resulted from both periodic intertribal warfare and the development of agriculture. Trade routes linked the tribal areas and their villages. In a successful effort to halt intertribal conflict, around 1570, five central New York tribes - the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondoga, Cayuga and Seneca formed the Iroquois Confederacy (Flanders 1998: 17).</description>

    <description>Manchu-Tungus languages are spoken in China, Mongolia, and the former USSR; this map depicts the locations of those spoken in China. Use of these languages is declining - as of 1982, there were around 4.4 million ethnic Manchu-Tungus in China, only 46,000 of whom spoke Manchu-Tungus languages. Most of these speakers are bilingual in Chinese and their ethnic language; some also speak another neighboring minority language.

Regarding classification, the authors note that ""some scholars outside China regard Xibo as a Manchu dialect, Oroqen as Evenki under a different name, and Hezhe as one of the sub-dialects ... of the Nanai language"". They also note that the terms ""Ewenki"" and ""Evenki"" are not synonymous; the former refers to an ethnic group living in China, the latter to one living in the former USSR. The languages spoken by these two groups are different.

We have digitized a number of cities and place names to provide context for these language locations, which you can view by selecting them in the legend. The abbreviation A.C. stands for ""'Autonomous County.""</description>

    <description>This work outlines the region of southern Africa where Bantu languages are spoken, and highlights the area where these languages make use of nasal harmony, a phenomenon in which some affixes have alternative forms to use when the root contains a nasal sound.  In the case of the Bantu languages, it can be observed with either a nasalized vowel or a consonant.  Greenberg uses this map to support his hypothesis regarding whether or not this may have been a trait inherited from Proto-Bantu or if it was introduced in another way (Greenberg).  Outside of Africa, this form of harmony is heard in many other languages, including Guaraní and Aguaruna.</description>

    <description>Intervowel -d- elision happens in all of the peninsula for certain contexts, but it clearly increases from north to south.
The words registered in the ALPI surveys that have been used in this map are: 
cazador (ALPI map 39)
dedo (ALPI map 63)
desnudo (ALPI map 66)

    <description>This map is complex, as in many of the surveyed points there is hesitation about pronouncing the final -d, generally voiceless (as the Castilian z) and most of the times relaxed, or not pronouncing anything. It's better to speak of a hesitation area in the Duero valley and upper Ebro, while in the rest of the peninsula the usual option is not pronouncing anything.<p>
The only word registered in the ALPI surveys that has been used in this map is verdad.</description>

    <description>This map comes from a series of individual maps of Yup'ik dialect differences. The distribution maps have been created from survey results completed by bilingual teachers in 61 out of 68 Yup’ik villages. While the respective points may be the same in size, this does not reflect the population density: some villages can have less than fifty speakers while others have populations up to a thousand. 
Please note: The letters correspond to the map's original image. Thus, in this map, A stands for <i>qauq</i>, B stands for <i>qauraq</i>, and C stands for <i>cung'uq</i>, D stands for <i>tatek</i>, and E stands for <i>tautek</i>.  
For the Yup’ik item—<i>Forehead</i>--Jacobson points out that the various Yup’ik words for ‘forehead’ are related to the meanings of the cognates in other Eskimo languages. He also notes that the distribution of this Yup’ik item is unusual because an uncommon form is shared by Hooper Bay- Chevak and the upper Kuskokwim.  
The table below shows Non-Yup'ik Languages that also share items of Yup'ik, the letters corresponding to the note above. The ones with an asterisk mean that there is no data found for the language.

    <description>'Moors Tamil' refers to the language spoken by the Arab Moors that settled in Sri Lanka. According to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Moors#Languages"" target=""blank"">Wikipedia</a>, there is no official name for this specific dialect, so it is generally referred to as 'Tamil.' This dialect has been heavily influenced by Arabic as it meshed with a number of indigenous Sri Lankan languages, and also those languages of immigrants from mainland India.

Each period is represented with different color text and can be turned on and off via the ""Active Layers"" tab. The original series of maps combined information from different sources, and as a result certain groups appear under multiple names. Although the term ""ethnic groups"" is used, Wassmann notes that most terms refer to locations or language names. The group names in the 1873-1907 data set, with Butam as the sole exception, are all taken from island names (for smaller islands) or region names (for the main island). During the period of 1947-1959, no new ethnic group names were mentioned.</description>

For the Yup’ik item—<i>Fish egg, roe</i>—Jacobson notes that <i>meluk</i> may be the nominal counterpart of <i>melug-</i> ‘to suck’. Cognates of <i>imlauk</i> means ‘fetus of an animal (especially a seal)’ in other Eskimo languages, and <i>cilluvak</i> and <i>cuak</i> may be cognates that found in various outlying areas of Yup’ik and in other Eskimo. He also points out that <i>cin'aq</i>means ‘aged fish eggs’ in Nunivak only and ‘aged fish’ in Yukon, Hooper Bay- Chevak, and Lake Iliamna (and in Alutiiq).

For the Yup’ik item—<i>Fish scale</i>Jacobson notes that in all Yupik languages and in Sirenikski <i>qelta</i> (and cognates) is used. It means ‘bark, peeling’ in Alutiiq and is a second meaning in Yup’ik.  A cognate of <i>kapeciq/ kapciq</i> is the Inupiaq word for ‘scale’, but it is not a loan word from Inupiaq. <i>kapeciq</i> is from proto-Eskimo and has disappeared except in the north where Inupiaq reinforcement may have play a role.

    <description>This map illustrates interethnic contact in the Bering Strait and Alaska area and the languages spoken there. Fifteen percent of Alaska is Native, of which 36,000 are of Eskimo descent. The majority of Alaska Natives speak English. According to van der Voort, there are many instances where Eskimos created grammatically reduced versions of their languages in order to communicate with monolingual speakers of other languages, and some developed into pidgins that served as a lingua franca. There is only limited information on such languages.</description>

    <description>Reflected upon this map is a new hypothesis of Austronesian expansion, based upon research in linguistics, archaeology and human genetics.  The majority of current studies agree that Taiwanese peoples are related both genetically and linguistically to Austronesians now living in southeast Asia and the Pacific, and many sources agree that they probably arrived on the island from mainland China around 6000 years ago.  From this point, however, linguistic and genetic hypotheses have diverged: historical linguists and archaeologists have so far supported a model in which Austronesians migrated south through the Philippines to what is now Indonesia, spreading east and west from there.  Geneticists, however, have found that many Austronesian populations are more closely related to their mainland Asian ancestors than they are to the Taiwanese, in effect making the Taiwan aboriginal peoples and the Austronesians parallel branches from the same tree. 
Also included here are several genetic and archaeological hypotheses of cultural contact and migration, including Blench's (2010) proposal of contact with the Indian subcontinent and Delfin et al.'s (2010) genetic relations with several Australian aboriginal groups.   
Rather than viewing Austronesian expansion as a series of straightforward migrations, it seems more and more necessary to delve more deeply into the history and culture of the peoples and the area in order to better reconstruct their history.  As further research is undertaken, more of these details will come to light, allowing interdisciplinary scholars to continue improving on what seems to be a solid foundational understanding of the region and its linguistic and genetic history.</description>

    <description>Shown here are migration routes for Austronesian-language speakers which resulted in the settlement of permanent populations.  Each path has been labeled according to the estimated date that it was taken, as determined through linguistic, archaeological and ecological research.  According to Cribb, the first Austronesians arrived in Taiwan around 4500 BC and from there progressed south before spreading outward (Cribb 2010).  This hypothesis differs from the one currently supported by genetic research, as shown in maps such as those listed in Other Resources below.</description>

    <description>This map is a graphical representation of the ""Express Train"" model of Austronesian migration, a popular hypothesis based on archaeological and linguistic research.  In their article, Gray and Jordan (2000) explain how they made use of a tree model, most commonly used in biology, to first create a language family tree.  Then, using statistical analysis, they analyzed the likelihood of their proposed sequence of events (in this case, the migration patterns) occurring.  Each of the circles on this map represents one of the stations compared against the language family tree.  They found that the hypothesized routes fit the language tree exceptionally well, and the statistical analysis showed that, ""that the express-train character-state tree fits the language tree with significantly fewer steps than would occur by chance,"" (Gray and Jordan 2000: 1053).

    <description>This map comes from a series of individual maps of Yup'ik dialect differences. The distribution maps have been created from survey results completed by bilingual teachers in 61 out of 68 Yup’ik villages. While the respective points may be the same in size, this does not reflect the population density: some villages can have less than fifty speakers while others have populations up to a thousand.
Please note: The letters correspond to the map's original image. Thus, in this map, A stands for <i>avaurluku</i>, B stands for <i>nalluyagulluku</i>, and C stands for <i>nalluqerluku</i>, D stands for <i> unimluku</i>, and E stands for <i>kic'iluku</i>.  
For the Yup’ik item—<i> Forgetting it</i>--Jacobson notes that the verb base<i>nalluyagute-</i> literally ‘to come to a state of not knowing’ is used in everywhere except Norton Sound Unaliq. <i>avaur-</i> ‘to forget’ is represented in Naukanski to the north, in Chugach Alutiiq to the south and in the peripheral Yup’ik dialects. therefore, Jacobson suggests that it may be the original Yup’ik word, and <i>nalluyagute-</i> (and <i>nalluqar-</i> ‘to suddenly not know’) may be a GCY innovation that spread to Koniag Alutiiq. <i>unime-</i> is related to <i>unite-</i> ‘to leave behind’ and <i>kic'i-</i> ‘to have something sink on one’, and both of which are localism according to Jacobson.

For the Yup’ik item—<i>Head</i>--Jacobson notes that <i>nasquq</i> is the northern Yup’ik word and has cognates in other Eskimo. <i>qamiquq</i> and <i>uqsuq</i> are found only in Yup’ik. <i>uqsuq</i> is used for ‘head’ in the upriver/far inland Yup’ik areas but occurs only as ‘aged fish head’ in Hooper Bay- Chevak and Norton Sound. It is also used throughout the southern part of Yup’ik in <i>uqsuqaq</i> PINTAIL DUCK. He also suggests that <i>iingaraq</i> (may from <i>ii</i> ‘eye’) on Nunivak is mainly used for ‘fish head’ but could also refer to ‘human or animal head’.

For the Yup’ik item—<i>Horse</i>—Jacobson notes the both Russian loan words: <i>kuuniq</i> from <i>kon’</i> and <i>luussitaq</i> from <i> lо́shad’</i>, and their isogloss follows a traditional north vs. south patter. <i>tunturpak</i>, literally means ‘big moose’, is used in Norton Sound Unaliq, and the area around Bethel uses the Yup’icized English word. He also mentions that the variant <i>luussatiq</i> (from Russian Mission) is closer to the Russian original, lо́shad’ than the common form <i>luussitaq</i> because Russian mission was the center of Russian influence.

    <description>This map comes from a series of individual maps of Yup'ik dialect differences. The distribution maps have been created from survey results completed by bilingual teachers in 61 out of 68 Yup’ik villages. While the respective points may be the same in size, this does not reflect the population density: some villages can have less than fifty speakers while others have populations up to a thousand. 
Please note: The letters correspond to the map's original image. Thus, in this map, A stands for <i>qayuqeggliq</i>, B stands for <i>ugasek</i>, and C stands for <i>negilirkaq</i>.  
For the Yup’ik item—<i>""Jackrabbit"", arctic hare</i>--Jacobson notes that <i>qayuqeggliq</i>&nbsp literally means ‘good for soup’, and “the Canineq localism <i>negilirkaq</i> means ‘raw material for a parka ruff’”. He suggests that <i>ugasek</i>&nbsp is an unusual word and may relate to <i>uatek</i> ‘haunches.’

For the Yup’ik item—<i>Lamp, light</i>—Jacobson notes that <i>naniq</i> is used in the northern part of Yup’ik similar to Eskimo languages to the north, and <i>kenurraq</i> is mostly used in the southern part with a cognate found to the north in Naukanski meaning ‘candle’. <i>Kenurraq</i> and <i>kuman</i> are based on <i>eke-</i> ‘to burn’, and <i>kuman</i> is derived from <i>kuma-</i> ‘to be lit’ and <i>–n</i> ‘instrument’, according to the author.  He suggests that <i>Kuman</i> occurring in Upper Kuskokwim, Nunivak, and the Egegik area supports the E.W. Nelson version of the Aglurmiut hypothesis. Finally he notes that “the Chugach Alutiiq form is a direct nominalization of <i>kuma-</i>"" and speculates that this is not cognate to <i>kuman</i>.

For the Yup’ik item—<i>Maqivik</i> (pronunciation)—Jacobson discusses the item assessing whether""<i>v</i> which is ungerminated between full vowels (i.e. not <i>e</i>) at a morpheme boundary"" pronounces as [v] or [w]. According to the map, the author points out that “peripheral GCY (with some exceptions) uses [v] and core GCY uses [w]”. Also, he notes that in Hooper Bay- Chevak <i>v</i> always is [v] and never [w]. One can compare a similar situation regarding to <i>y</i> and <i>s</i> at HEY YOU WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

For the Yup’ik item—<i>Milk</i>—Jacobson addresses the question concerning the word for ‘canned milk’, ‘milk in a carton’, etc. According to the author, a Russian loan word is used except in Norton Sound Unaliq which uses <i>amngaq</i> ‘breast milk’. <i>Malak'uuq</i>, used only in Nunivak, Nelson Is, and Stebbins, is a more common Russian pronunciation from the Russian source word <i>molokо́</i> and <i>muluk'uuq</i> has less Russian sounding. He suggests that the Russians who introduced ‘milk’ might have spoken minority dialect of Russian. Finally, he points out that in several areas there is <i>milek</i> from English and <i>milek’uuq</i> from a blend of English and Russian.

    <description>This map comes from a series of individual maps of Yup'ik dialect differences. The distribution maps have been created from survey results completed by bilingual teachers in 61 out of 68 Yup’ik villages. While the respective points may be the same in size, this does not reflect the population density: some villages can have less than fifty speakers while others have populations up to a thousand. 
Please note: The letters correspond to the map's original image. Thus, in this map, A stands for <i>al'qaq</i>, B stands for <i>alqaq</i>, C stands for <i>alleqaq</i>, and D stands for <i>al'aq</i>.  
For the Yup’ik item—<i>Older sister</i>—Jacobson discusses the variety forms of Yup’ik word for ‘older sister’. H states that <i>*aleqaq</i> must have been the original Yup’ik form comparing with Inupiaq, and the “hatted” <i>e</i> has been deleted to give <i>al'qaq</i> and therefore, <i>alqaq</i>, in and beyond areas “where a voiced fricative cannot precede a stop"". One can compare this to (IT) WILL SPILL. Also, he suggests that <i>alleqaq</i> in Norton Sound Unaliq may be “from a reinsertion of this ‘hatted’ <i>e</i> but with <i>l</i>               kept voiceless.” Finally, he points out that “<i>al’a</i> is a widespread casual or endearing form of the basic word” but may have replaced <i>alqaq</i> to a degree in the Lake Iliamna area.

    <description>This map comes from a series of individual maps of Yup'ik dialect differences. The distribution maps have been created from survey results completed by bilingual teachers in 61 out of 68 Yup’ik villages. While the respective points may be the same in size, this does not reflect the population density: some villages can have less than fifty speakers while others have populations up to a thousand. 
Please note: The letters correspond to the map's original image. Thus, in this map, A stands for <i>qiini</i> and B stands for <i>qagaani</i>.
For the Yup’ik item—<i>(In the extended area) out there</i>—Jacobson discusses the item that addresses the formation of adverbs from the three demonstrative pronouns <i>agna</i> ‘that across there (extended)’, <i>pagna</i> ‘that up there (extended)’, and <i>qagna</i> ‘that out there (extended)’. The standard pattern for this adverb formation is that “the final segment <i>na</i> of the pronoun is replaced with <i>ani</i> (and similarly for case other than the localis), giving first <i>*agani,*pagani</i>, and <i>*qagani</i> (compare <i>amani</i> ‘over there (obscured)’ and then by velar-dropping and vowel-raising these become <i>iini</i> ‘across there’, <i>piini</i> ‘up there’, and <i>qiini</i> ‘out there’. While Norton Sound, Nunivak and the area where the Yukon and Kuskokwim are close together and follow this standard pattern, all the rest of Yup’ik avoid such vowel-raising and insert an extra <i>a</i> instead to give <i>aga<u>a</u>ni, paga<u>a</u>ni, and qaga<u>a</u>ni</i>. The author notes that the vowel-raising (not the velar-dropping) is “objectionable,” and therefore, from the demonstrative pronoun <i>ugna</i> ‘that toward exist (restrict)’, one gets the adverb *ugani and hence <i>uani</i> ‘toward exit’.

For the Yup’ik item—<i>Pants</i>—Jacobson notes the word for ‘pants’ which is ""shibboleth"" to distinguish Bristol Bay and Kuskokwim, and other examples are BOAT, “RABBIT”, COAT, and (BEING) SICK. Due to the use of cognates of <i>qerrulliik</i> in Eskimo languages to the north of Yup’ik and of <i>ulruk</i> in Alutiiq, the pattern can be north vs. south with the division line far to the south (COOKING is another example). FISHHOOK is a case of the division line in the middle.

    <description>This map comes from a series of individual maps of Yup'ik dialect differences. The distribution maps have been created from survey results completed by bilingual teachers in 61 out of 68 Yup’ik villages. While the respective points may be the same in size, this does not reflect the population density: some villages can have less than fifty speakers while others have populations up to a thousand. 
Please note: The letters correspond to the map's original image. Thus, in this map, A stands for <i>cegluni</i>, B stands for <i>segluni</i>, C stands for <i>essgiluni</i>, and D stands for <i>ulligciluni</i>. 
For the Yup’ik item—<i>Cutting fish for drying</i>--Jacobson notes that the distribution of the variants <i>cegluni/ segluni/ essgiluni</i>&nbsp is predictable and can be found in TEA & SUGAR, and the others. <i>Ulligciluni</i>&nbsp is a localism from Bethel area and is not related to <i>ullirciluni</i>&nbsp ‘to split the belly.’ He also points out that <i>ceg-</i>&nbsp and <i>seg-</i>&nbsp are “agentive” verb base, and <i>esseg-</i> (in Nunivak) and <i>ulligte-</i>&nbsp are “patientive.”  
The table below shows Non-Yup'ik Languages that also share items of Yup'ik, the letters corresponding to the note above. The ones with an asterisk mean that there is no data found for the language.

    <description>This map shows some of the village languages along the Upper Digul River, as documented by Hughes's (2009) survey of the area. 
The survey mainly focused on the Wambon, Tsaukambo, Komyandaret and Nakai languages.
Hughes (2009) further mentions that there is a village - Tangop - where the language Sait is spoke, which is located somewhere 
north of Gaguop in the hills. East of Manggelum a language identified as Namá is spoken in the village Kuken while the language
Kitum is spoken in both Kuken and another village, Moget. Hughes has no coordinates for these places, and it has not been possible 
to locate them through the NGA geospatial database. 
Hughes was able to find coordinates for four Na'i speaking villages in an aerial survey, which are also shown on the map.</description>

    <description>Based on anthropologists’ traditional division of North American Indian culture areas and the most conservative classification of American Indian languages, there are four large culture areas with three major language families in northern North America. The Arctic, a single culture area, is dominated by Eskimo-Aleut language speakers. The Western Subarctic is the area of Na-Dene languages, while the Eastern Subarctic culture speaks Algonquian-Ritwan languages. Northwest Coast includes the culture area with Na-Dene and smaller language families. However, it is noteworthy that the Salishan language is not discussed as a major family.</description>

    <description>New Guinea Pidgin (Tok Pisin) is the the dominant spoken variety in Papua New Guinea, as can be seen from this map.  Its origins lie in the plantations in Samoa where there was English language contact among labourers.  Its use then spread across Papua New Guinea and it still possesses typical creole characteristics.  This map also shows the movements of specific varieties of Lingua Francas.  Most of the Lingua Francas were developed as a result of missionary activity of the churches.

    <description>The realization of Polish nasal vowels is associated with extensive variation. One of the most common processes heard in contemporary speech is the decomposition of nasals. This map presents the distribution of several decomposed variants of the front and back nasal vowels. Specifically, it maps the decomposition of the front nasal into /en/ and /ej/ before spirants, and into /em/ word-finally. Additionally, it presents areas where the back nasal is decomposed word-finally only in nouns, adjectives, pronouns, and numerals, as well as areas where it is also decomposed word-finally in verbs.</description>

    <description>This map illustrates the major families of indigenous languages in South America during Pre-Columbian times. Macro-Chibchan and Arawak are the major language families in lower Central America. In particular, Macro-Chibchan speakers dominated the area from Nicaragua through Panama to coastal Columbia and Venezuela (which is called circum-Caribbean groups).  The Arawak had long dominated the Greater Antilles, however, in the late period before Conquest, Arawak was threatened by the Carib from northeastern South America. Furthermore, within a century of the Spanish arrival, the number of Arawak decreased due to Spanish aggression and diseases brought from Spain. The Amazon Basin is the area of influx of many peoples, thus many languages such as Arawakan and Carib are spoken in the area. Quechua, the official language was the lingua franca of Inca Empire. The Inca Empire spread from Cuzco, in the southern highlands, down into Chile and northwest Argentina and up through Ecuador.</description>

Named for their remarkable earthworks, most of which were burial mounds, these mound cultures occupied the area bordered to the west by the Illinois and Mississippi rivers, and to the east by Lake Ontario. While both cultures had core areas in the Ohio Valley, only the Hopewell occupied the sprawled area throughout the midwest. (Flanders, 18)</description>

    <description>Native English speakers from Southeastern Michigan were asked a simple question- ""Where are the most (and least) 'correct' and 'pleasant' varieties [of American English] spoken?"" Participants rated each of the 50 states, as well as the District of Columbia and New York City, from 1 to 10. Each region was then assigned a numerical range which reflects its average score, with higher numbers being more 'correct' or 'pleasant,' and lower scores indicating 'incorrect' or 'unpleasant.' 
The study states that when a speaker rates his or her own region as being more correct, the respondent is showing what is known as ""Linguistic Confidence."" Comparing the maps demonstrates that regions with low Linguistic Confidence rate their specific region as more pleasant, while areas with high Linguistic Confidence rate multiple other regions as pleasant as their own.</description>

As specified in Asher and Moseley, the time of contact varied for each language; most of the coastal languages were first identified during the 16th and 17th centuries, although some languages in the interior of South America became known much more recently during the 20th century (Kaufman 2007). This original map was made by vectorizing data from the MultiTree language database and the Atlas of the World's Languages.</description>

    <description>Native English speakers from the American South were asked a simple question- ""Where are the most (and least) 'correct' and 'pleasant' varieties [of American English] spoken?"" Participants rated each of the 50 states, as well as the District of Columbia and New York City, from 1 to 10. Each region was then assigned a numerical range which reflects its average score, with higher numbers being more 'correct' or 'pleasant,' and lower scores indicating 'incorrect' or 'unpleasant.' 
The study states that when a speaker rates his or her own region as being more correct, the respondent is showing what is known as ""Linguistic Confidence."" Comparing the maps demonstrates that regions with low Linguistic Confidence rate their specific region as more pleasant, while areas with high Linguistic Confidence rate multiple other regions as pleasant as their own.</description>

    <description>91% of Taiwan's population is Chinese-speaking, but there is still a proportion of indigenous peoples who speak Austronesian varieties. Traditionally, the indigenous peoples were split into the Mountain People and the Plains People. This map shows the distribution and further subdivisions of the Mountain People. The Plains People could originally be found on the western side of the island, but various political movements have displaced this population.</description>

    <description>The shaded regions of this map outline areas of scattered Pygmoid and Twa populations.  These groups often dwell in rainforest or remote swamp areas, and many speak Bantu languages.  Roger Blench cites Serge Bahuchet who argues that they may have once spoken a language unique from those of their surrounding groups, but that over time, they absorbed the surrounding languages due to the relationships formed with the incoming Bantu cultivators.  This information is part of a larger work which describes the history and current status of various language groups throughout the continent in order to reconstruct the African past.</description>

    <description>Researcher Richard Caulfield, at the time of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, recorded speakers of Gwich'in Athabaskan naming different features of the geography around their home villages. Because the speakers are from relatively close villages and speak the same dialect, we see overlap in placename use.

    <description>This map intends to show the distribution of the indigenous languages of the eastern part of the island of New Guinea, that is, the part that belongs to the Independent State of Papua New Guinea (It thus excludes, for the time being, the Indonesian part of the island and the smaller islands included in Papua New Guinea.) Papua New Guinea is the country in the world that is home to the largest number of living languages, estimated at 830, or 12 per cent of all languages in the world. Of these, 700 are spoken on the main island. Although the geographical area covered is only about 400,000 sq. kms, this makes up roughly 10 per cent of the languages of the world. The map contains full or partial information about approximately 550 of these, or almost 8 per cent of the world's languages.</description>

    <description>This map shows the distribution of Māori-speaking populations in the mid-1970s. Migration contributed to the weakening of Māori use in Māori-speaking communities, putting the language at risk of eventually dying out.  Since the 1970s special measures have been put in place in attempt to preserve Māori.</description>

    <description>Native English speakers from the American South were asked a simple question- ""Where are the most (and least) 'correct' and 'pleasant' varieties [of American English] spoken?"" Participants rated each of the 50 states, as well as the District of Columbia and New York City, from 1 to 10. Each region was then assigned a numerical range which reflects its average score, with higher numbers being more 'correct' or 'pleasant,' and lower scores indicating 'incorrect' or 'unpleasant.' 
The study states that when a speaker rates his or her own region as being more correct, the respondent is showing what is known as ""Linguistic Confidence."" Comparing the maps demonstrates that regions with low Linguistic Confidence rate their specific region as more pleasant, while areas with high Linguistic Confidence rate multiple other regions as pleasant as their own.</description>

Only population categories can be given since Bajau are known to migrate frequently, compared to other groups.

    <description>This map shows the Inca Empire expansion and shows its road system. Though many descriptions about the Inca are mixed with legends and myths, around 1438-93, under the rulers Pachacutec and his son Tupac Yupanqui, the Inca had expanded from a small chiefdom to the empire shown in this map. The Inca Empire spread from Cuzco, in the southern highlands, down into Chile, northwest Argentina, and up through Ecuador. One aspect of the Inca Empire often noted is its brevity: the Inca state lasted for 90 years or so, and the Inca Empire for little more than 50 years before Spanish colonization. The roads are foundational to the Inca people. Additionally, the Inca's roads system were the centers for transportation and goods storage.</description>

    <description>Pictured here are the main paths of migration taken by various crops and animals as they spread across the southern half of Africa.  The labels for sorgum, finger millet and pearl millet indicate which paths these three particular grain crops took; their collection and harvesting provided support of much larger populations, and allowed group populations to grow steadily.  Similarly important, the keeping of domestic animals began early in the first millenium BCE and traveled down the continent.

Each period is represented with different color text and can be turned on and off via the ""Active Layers"" tab.The original series of maps combined information from different sources, and as a result certain languages appear under multiple names. Wassmann notes that in many cases linguistic boundaries could not be precisely transferred or are known to be inaccurate. In the 1873-1907 data set, Kapsu and Pakail are the only true language names; all other terms refer to the island or regions where a particular language is spoken.</description>

In some specific areas of Australia (as shown on this map) the pidgin has creolized to give Australian creoles.  At some points along the east coast Queensland Canefields English is spoken, which sugar-cane plantation labourers developed and used.

Note for reading these maps: The original LSI maps do not indicate boundaries or areas for all languages/dialects. This is why some language/dialect names appear simply as labels, while others appear as areas. That is, these two categories of labels are not meaningfully different (i.e. they do not represent different subgroups or anything similar) unless the legend specifically indicates otherwise.</description>

    <description>'Kandyan Sinhalese' is a name used to describe the indigenous inhabitants of the Kandyan region of Sri Lanka. These are ancestors of the old 'Kandyan Kingdom,' and, due to their isolated geographic location, they have retained a different cultural identity that contrasts them with the 'Low Country Sinhalese' people. The Kandyan Sinhalese people speak the language 'Sinhala,' which, due to the relative isolation of the language to the island of Sri Lanka, developed differently from the other Indo-Aryan languages spoken in northern mainland India.
Notes on reading this map:
This map is designed to be overlaid onto other maps of Sri Lanka, in order to gain a more in depth view of the languages spoken on the island.</description>

    <description>This map comes from a series of individual maps of Yup'ik dialect differences. The distributions maps have been created from survey results completed by bilingual teachers in 61 out of 68 Yup’ik villages. While the respective points may be the same in size, this does not reflect the population density: some villages can have less than fifty speakers while others have populations up to a thousand. 
Please note: The letters correspond to the map's original image. Thus, in this map, A stands for <i>qalqapak</i> while B stands for <i>piqertuutaq</i>, C stands for <i>piqrutaq</i> and D stands for<i>tupuuluq</i>. 
For the Yup’ik item—<i>AXE</i>—Jacobson notes that the <i>axe</i> is maybe recent tool for Yup’iks. <i>qalqapak</i> is a loan from Chukchi and <i>tupuuluq</i> is loan from Russian. 
The table below shows Non-Yup'ik Languages that also share items of Yup'ik, the letters corresponding to the note above. The ones with an asterisk mean that there is no data found for the language.

    <description>This maps illustrates the locations of various language areas and ethnic groups prominent in Siberia during the 17th Century. According to Stephen A. Wurm, much of the changes in the ethnic and linguistic situation is a result of the expansion of these indigenous groups, notably the Yakuts, the Paleoasiatic Chukchis and to a lesser degree the Evens (Lamuts). It is important to note that the Even ethnic group, believed to be numbered at 7,000 in the middle of the 17th century, dropped to 4,000 people by the end of that same century due to small pox epidemics.</description>

On LSI maps of language families, such as this one, it is not always clear or consistent whether names refer to <i>languages</i> or <i>subgroups</i>. In our digitized versions, we have included the maximal language coding possible (i.e. if a name could refer to either a language or a subgroup, we include codes for both).
<p>
Note for reading these maps: Zoom in to see all the points listed in the legend. Also the original LSI maps do not indicate boundaries or areas for all languages/dialects. This is why some language/dialect names appear simply as labels, while others appear as areas. That is, these two categories of labels are not meaningfully different (i.e. they do not represent different subgroups or anything similar) unless the legend specifically indicates otherwise.</description>

    <description>Though the Yukagirs occupied much of the northern Siberia around 1650, a reduction in their area and numbers took place largely because of Chukchi expansion in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In addition, many Yukagirs died from introduced diseases such as smallpox in the eighteenth century. According to Stephen A. Wurm, the Yukagirs had developed writing system composed of symbolic signs until the 19th century. The Yukagirs numbered about 5,000 at the middle of the seventeenth century and dropped to 400 in 19th century.</description>

This is one of the most well-documented language subgroups in the Americas.  Its extensive study has even lead to the partial reconstruction of Proto-Mayan, which is estimated to have been spoken at least 5,000 years ago.  Another unique characteristic of Mayan was its written form; during the pre-Columbian era, some languages in the group were written using a hieroglyphic script (Wikipedia).</description>

For the Yup’ik item—<i>Forty</i>—Jacobson discusses that the word <i>yuinag</i> or <i>ipiaq</i> (related to <i>ipi(k) </i> ‘limb of a quadraped’) for ‘twenty’ assesses  its multiples forms such as ‘forty’, ‘sixty,’ ‘eight.’ <i>yuinaq</i> (or variants) is used for ‘twenty’ itself (and 21-39) as opposed to higher numerals in all areas. He also notes that ""<i>ipiaq</i> is always singular, but <i>yuinaq</i> takes its grammatical number from the multiplier"" (<i>yuinaak</i> is the dual). <i>pingayun ipiaq</i> is ‘sixty’ in one system and in the other <i>yuinaat pingayun</i> where <i>yuinaat</i> is plural.

The Turkic languages in China are spoken by seven of China's 56 ethnic groups: Uighur, Kazak, Kirghiz, Salar, Uzbek, Tartar, and Yugur. The languages of the former six have the same name as their ethnic group. The  Yugurs are divided into two language communities: those who speak Western Yugur, a Turkic language, and Eastern Yugur, a Mongolian language (not shown on this map). Most members of these groups also speak Mandarin Chinese; some additionally speak neighboring minority languages such as Mongolian, Tajik, or Xibo.

    <description>This map outlines several of the important African kingdoms and empires, as well as groups of people, in northern Africa circa 1750-1770 (Ehret).  During this time, European influence on the continent was widespread; trade and conquest were flourishing under the colonial powers.  In the east, Ottoman Empire power was beginning to fail in Egypt, and many of the Arab groups that had once been under their rule broke away.  Along the Atlantic coast, many of those involved with European trade prospered, especially Morocco.</description>

It is important to note that the Even ethnic group, believed to be numbered at 7,000 in the middle of the 17th century, dropped to 4,000 people by the end of that same century due to small pox epidemics.</description>

The main dialects shown are Min and Hakka, although a few other Chinese dialects are also included. The map groups the Taiwan-Austronesian languages native to Taiwan into bilingual areas because a large number of these people also speak the Minnan dialect. On Hainan Island, the language situation is more complex; Maihua (Yue dialect), Zhangzhouhua (Yue dialect), Hakka, Junhua (Southwestern Mandarin dialect), Lin'gao, Cun, Li, Yao, and possibly Austronesian Cham are all spoken in various communities. Thus, parts of the island are also considered multi-lingual areas. See the original source for more details.

    <description>This map depicts the Abkhaz-Adyghe Ethnic and Linguistic Groups in southwest Russia and Georgia as they were in the 1830's. The map is divided broadly into three groups - Adyghe, Ubykh, and Abkhaz Abaza and also includes layers depicting residential areas and pasture land. This map has been modified from it's original in the Atlas of the Caucasian languages, and historical cities in this region have also been added. Abkhaz-Abaza: Abkhaz, Sadskzo Divisions, the Ethnic groups named Ahibga, Art, Baga, Goch', Tsanda, and Tsvykdzhi are listed as text on the original map and are represented here as text labels representing an approximate geographical location; the same is the case for the Adyghe, Western Circassian Dividison in the Adyghe (dialect unspecified) regions for the following ethnic groups: Bzhedugh, Cherchenay,Khegaki, Natekuay, X'imisch. It should also be noted that the populated places on this map are the places indicated in the original map and do not represent an exhaustive list of populated places for this region.</description>

    <description>This map provides a general overview for the overall linguistic situation in China. The map shows the locations of the most general Chinese dialect groups, as well as the non-Chinese language families that are spoken throughout China. Though Chinese dialects are widely spoken through central, Southern and North-Western China, there are also many regions where national languages are used, and many where these languages are spoken alongside of Chinese dialects, or other national languages.</description>

This particular map shows the speech varieties of the Bihari language. The cross-hatched areas have two different meanings:
> A cross-hatched area on a blank background indicates that Bihari is ""spoken by immigrant settlers"" there.
> A cross-hatched area on top of another Bihari area indicates that the dialect spoken in the indicated area is ""corrupted"" by the overlying one.
<p>
Note for reading these maps: The original LSI maps do not indicate boundaries or areas for all languages/dialects. This is why some language/dialect names appear simply as labels, while others appear as areas. That is, these two categories of labels are not meaningfully different (i.e. they do not represent different subgroups or anything similar) unless the legend specifically indicates otherwise.</description>

    <description>This map comes from a series of individual maps of Yup'ik dialect differences. The distribution maps have been created from survey results completed by bilingual teachers in 61 out of 68 Yup’ik villages. While the respective points may be the same in size, this does not reflect the population density: some villages can have less than fifty speakers while others have populations up to a thousand. 
Please note: The letters correspond to the map's original image. Thus, in this map, A stands for <i>(e)vek</i>, B stands for <i>canek</i>.  
For the Yup’ik item—<i>Grass</i>--Jacobson notes that cognates of <i>canek</i> mean ‘debris, dust, twig, etc.’ in other Eskimo languages. <i>(e)vek</i> (an otherwise pan-Eskimo word for ‘grass’) is used only in some divergent dialects. <i>(e)vek</i> occurs in <i>(e)vegtar-</i> ‘to gather grass’ and <i>(e)vegtaq</i> BUMBLE BEE  in some <i>(e)vek</i> areas of Yup’ik. 
The table below shows Non-Yup'ik Languages that also share items of Yup'ik, the letters corresponding to the note above. The ones with an asterisk mean that there is no data found for the language.

    <description>The Linguistic Survey of India (LSI) was a survey of the languages of British India, conducted in the first several decades of the 20th century by the British Raj and directed by Irish linguist George A Grierson. This particular map shows the languages and locations of the Dardic ""family"". (Grierson considered Dardic and Indo-Aryan separate ""branches"" of the Aryan languages, though modern scholars include Dardic within Indo-Aryan.)
<p>
On LSI maps of language families, such as this one, it is not always clear or consistent whether names refer to <i>languages</i> or <i>subgroups</i>. In our digitized versions, we have included the maximal language coding possible (i.e. if a name could refer to either a language or a subgroup, we include codes for both).
<p>
Note for reading these maps: The original LSI maps do not indicate boundaries or areas for all languages/dialects. This is why some language/dialect names appear simply as labels, while others appear as areas. That is, these two categories of labels are not meaningfully different (i.e. they do not represent different subgroups or anything similar) unless the legend specifically indicates otherwise.</description>
    <related>This is a language family map. LL-MAP has digitized LSI maps for the following other language families, which you may want to overlay on this map for a more complete picture:
[Austro-Asiatic & Pronominalized Himalayan](ContributionTable#cldf:340620) |

In addition, many Yukagirs died from introduced diseases such as smallpox in the eighteenth century. According to Stephen A.

The Yukagirs numbered about 5,000 at the middle of the seventeenth century and dropped to 400 in 19th century.</description>

While enclaves of the language are spoken throughout the island, the largest concentration is along the eastern coast. This is the portion of the island that is commonly associated as being Tamil speaking.

The names of local dialects used in the Language Atlas of China may refer to current, historical or traditional place names of features where the dialect is spoken. This map shows the locations of these dialects, which cover the majority of China excluding Tibet and parts of Inner Mongolia. The vast majority of Chinese speakers use a variety of the Mandarin Supergroup, while speakers in Southeastern China may use Hakka, Yue, Gan, Wu, Xiang, or Minnan. There are a total of 22 or 23 dialect groups shown on this map, the author being unsure on the classification of Xianghua. This number includes groups within the two major Chinese subgroups.</description>

    <description>This map shows the distribution of the language groups of southeastern Europe around the mid 4th century BC. In this map the Messapii are shown as speaking an Illyrian dialect, but this is no longer accepted by most specialists in the field (Kretschmer 1896 & Hirt 1898).

    <description>This map comes from a series of individual maps of Yup'ik dialect differences. The distribution maps have been created from survey results completed by bilingual teachers in 61 out of 68 Yup’ik villages. While the respective points may be the same in size, this does not reflect the population density: some villages can have less than fifty speakers while others have populations up to a thousand. 
Please note: The letters correspond to the map's original image. Thus, in this map, A stands for <i>cang'uq, neqlernaq</i>, B stands for <i>neqetuq</i>, and C stands for <i>neqtuq</i>. 
For the Yup’ik item—<i>(He) caught fish</i>-Jacobson discussed the standard way of saying ‘he caught fish.’ All Yup’iks and Norton Sound Unaliq use <i>neqtuq</i>.  <i>cang'uq</i> is restricted to the southern part of Yup’ik. He also notes that the postbase <i>–nge-</i> is an innovation despite that “the verb base <i>cange-</i> means ‘ to acquire something’ because ""<i>–nge-</i> is not used for acquiring fish or game animals by catching them”.

For the Yup’ik item—<i>He got bit by a dog</i>--Jacobson discusses the variants postbase: <i>–(s)cir</i>, used in peripheral GCY and  <i>-(s)ciur</i>, used in core GCY, both of which are one of the few ways to form a passive in Yup’ik. These postbases are not used in Norton Sound Unaliq and part of the greater Bristol Bay area except for <i>qimugtem keggaa</i>. The use of whether terminalis <i>qimugtemun</i> or ablative-modalis <i>qimugtemek</i> could contribute to the difference of syntax, and is only obvious between central coastal area and the lower and middle Kuskokwim.</description>

For the Yup’ik item—<i>(He) keeps being sad--</i>Jacobson addresses the issue of “<i>(ar)</i> deletion” and “<i>rar</i> reduction” and notes that there is no general pattern can be found. Complete deletion of <i>(ar)</i> giving <i>ilutequ'urtuq</i> from the underlying form <i>ilutequrartuq</i> is obligatory in lower Kuskokwim, Canineq, Nelson Is, Nunivak, the middle and upriver Yukon, and in the greater Bristol Bay area. Partial reduction is found in Norton Sound, the Yukon delta, Hooper Bay- Chevak and Egegik.

    <description>This map depicts minority languages spoken in Northern China. The language areas shown subsume about 40% of China's land area, 15% of its population, and 25% of its minority language speakers. Of the languages displayed on the map, by far the most widely spoken is Uygur, with almost 6 million speakers, followed by Mongolian, with 3 million, and Korean, with 1.8 million.
<p>
The authors describe the minority languages of Northern China as ""a belt across the top of China"" divided into four sections:
1. the westernmost, consisting of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, in which Uygur and Kazak speakers are most populous;
2. the northern parts of Qinhai and Gansu, and the western part of Inner Mongolia, where speakers of Mongolian, Tibetan and Dongxiang are most populous;
3. the eastern and central part of Inner Mongolia, where speakers of Mongolian are most populous;
4. and Manchuria, in which Korean speakers are most populous.
In the latter three regions, Chinese dialects are more widely spoken than minority languages; only in Xinjiang are minority languages more common.
<p>
Note: Some language areas that were present in the original image have been left off this map, to prevent confusing overlap with the [Minority Languages of Southern China.](ContributionTable#cldf:344977)</description>
    <related>For a more complete picture, you may find it useful to view this map in conjunction with

    <description>The People's Republic of China recognizes 55 minority ethnic groups or ""national minorities"" whose populations range from under 1,500 (e.g. the Hezhe) to over 13 million members (e.g. the Zhuang). This map shows the locations of these populations within the PRC using a combination of point data for smaller communities and area features for large, widespread communities, though only the most concentrated areas and points can be represented.
    Many of the ethnic groups shown in this map are related either linguistically or anthropologically. In this map, more closely related ethnic groups are typically shown as different shades of the same or similar colors, where possible.</description>

For the Yup’ik item—<i>I don't love him</i>—Jacobson discusses the prosody difference among the two subdialects of the Norton Sound dialect and the rest of Yup’ik. He notes that “neither the Kotlik nor Unaliq subdialects of Norton Sound retract stress from an open syllable (<i>ri</i> in <i>ken(e)kenritaqa</i>) to a preceding closed syllable, which is unlike the rest of Yup’ik. According to the author, Unaliq “retains stressed e in an open syllable (the second <i>e</i> in <i>kenékenritaqa</i>), and then closes the syllable by germinating the following consonant” which is unlike Kotlik and the rest of Yup’ik.

For the Yup’ik item—<i>It is up above there</i>--Jacobson notes that this item “assesses the degree to which the largely obsolete verb base <i>ete-</i> ‘to be’ forms a contraction with the localis case, particularly the demonstrative adverbs such as pikani ‘up above there.’"" He also discusses that the uncontracted two-word form is used only in Nunivak, and elsewhere contraction gives <i>pikanetuq</i> that goes one step further into <i>pika'antuq</i>. It is a process of deletion of a certain vowel that creates a long and unrhythmical vowel which does not cause germination. its process is similar to the case (HE) KEEPS BEING SAD.  Finally the author points out the last step is ""obligatory (with demonstrative adverbs) except in outlying dialect areas and the very central area of Nunapitchuk, Kasigluk and Atmaulluak"".</description>

For the Yup’ik item—<i>It will spill</i>--Jacobson examines a “‘hatted’ <i>e</i> (an <i>e</i> which is in a position whereby were it another vowel it would be rhythmically lengthened) which arises during word construction.” An <i>e</i> is retained and the following consonant is germinated in Norton Sound Unaliq and is deleted in the rest of Yup’ik unless it is between consonants. He notes, in Hooper Bay- Chevak, in Egegik and most peripheral GCY “if deletion of a ‘hatted’ <i>e</i> causes a voiced fricative to be followed by a stop or voiceless fricative the fricative in question stays voiced (as shown by the apostrophe). In core GCY and in Nunivak if a fricative ends up being followed by a stop or voiceless fricative for that reason that the fricative in question becomes voiceless.” The author also points out that areas using <i>kuveciquq</i> would also use germinated <i>ll</i> for <i>nerelleq</i> ‘the one that ate,’ and areas using <i>kuv'ciquq</i> would say <i>ner’lleq</i>, and areas using <i>kuvciquq</i> would say <i>nerrleq</i>.

For the Yup’ik item—<i>Jumping</i>--Jacobson discusses that <i>qeckar-</i>, the most widespread Yup’ik verb base for ‘to jump’, is from <i>qeceg-</i> with a postbase meaning ‘suddenly’. The postbase has become fused to the base in many areas so <i>qeceg-</i> alone is used in certain outlying areas. He also notes that cognates of the expanded base <i>qeckar-</i> are used both to the north and south of Yup’ik. <i>Meceg-</i> is limited to the area in contact with Inupiaq.

The word <i>uluaq</i> is used almost everywhere in Yup’ik, while the word <i>kegginalek</i> is found only in Hooper Bay. Thus the word <i>kegginalek</i> is a local innovation with the literal meaning ‘one with a sharp edge (kegginaq, basically ‘face’)’.

For the Yup’ik item—<i>Bumble bee</i>—Jacobson notes that <i>(e)vegtaq</i>&nbsp ‘thing of the grass’ (the general eskimo word) is used for ‘bee’. <i>Megtaq</i>&nbsp is a variant of <i>(e)vegtaq</i> and may be the imitative sound of bee.  <i>Uuqnikuq</i>&nbsp  and <i>uuqnituq</i>&nbsp  are “localisms” said by children to bees. <i>Panayuli</i>&nbsp  ‘one that is good at spearing’ is a ""regionalism"" according to Jacobson.

    <description>This map comes from a series of individual maps of Yup'ik dialect differences. The distribution maps have been created from survey results completed by bilingual teachers in 61 out of 68 Yup’ik villages. While the respective points may be the same in size, this does not reflect the population density: some villages can have less than fifty speakers while others have populations up to a thousand. 
Please note: The letters correspond to the map's original image. Thus, in this map, A stands for <i>paunraq</i>, B stands for <i>tan'gerpak</i>, and C stands for <i>kavlakuaraq</i>.  
For the Yup’ik item—<i>Crowberry</i>--Jacobson notes that <i> paunraq</i>&nbsp has been the original Yup’ik name for small black berry and now is used in most Eskimo, the north of Yup’ik, outlaying Nunivak, and Egegik. <i>Tan'gerpak</i>, literally means ‘big blackness,’ is the most widespread Yup’ik name. <i>Kavlakuaraq</i>&nbsp means ‘small bearberry' (<i>kavlak</i>) in Hooper Bay- Chevak localism.

For the Yup’ik item—<i>One hundred</i>—Jacobson notes that 20 is the base on the Eskimo numerical system, so <i>yuinaat talliman</i> literally means ‘five twenties’, and <i>talliman ipiaq</i> is the same idea and one can see the discussion of <i>ipiaq</i> instead of <i>yuinaq</i> at FORTY. Surprisingly there are two words for 100 and may be from post-contact. The author speculates that <i>kavluun</i> may be a loan “used for primer caps which came in packs of 100”, and <i>negavaq</i> sounds like it is from <i>negaq</i> ‘snare, mesh of net’, and could be related to some net measurement.

One can find cognates of both <i>callmak</i> and <i>ilaaq</i> (means ‘addition’ in Alutiiq) to north and south of Yup’ik.

    <description>The map shows the locations of four villages where Shugule, Mouhour, Mefele and Sirak are spoken. It was created
		using data from Karyn Crawford's work on Mefele (Crawford 2005).
	Mefele is spoken in the Far North Province of Cameroon, Mayo-Tsanaga
Division, Mokolo Subdivision. The dialects, which generally consist of one village each and which are named after that village,
are located near Mokolo (Crawford 2005)- the sixth-largest city in the province. 
Crawford gives the following population data for the villages:

Both<i>Keggsuli</i>  literally ‘good biter’ and <i>ciulek</i> ‘one with a front’ are “appropriate descriptive terms” for this fish. <i>Cuukvak</i> (predictable variant <i>cukvak</i> with “vowel compression”, see also KNEE) also occurs in <i>luqruuyak</i> area in the form of <i>cuukvaguaq</i> ‘alder tree’, literally ‘pretend, or one like, a <i>cuukvak</i>’.

He suggests that <i>issaluuq/ issaluq</i> may be a loan because its usual phonology, and the same form means ‘flock of birds take off in flight’ from Aleut.

The apical “r” in place of Yup’ik <i>l</i>                       in the Alutiiq cognate of <i>ilavkuku</i> indicates the Russian origin. However, these two forms <i>milu'uvkaaq/ pilu'uvkaaq</i> and <i>ilavkuku</i>are so different that it is hard to see that they are the same Russian source.

    <description>This map comes from a series of individual maps of Yup'ik dialect differences. The distribution maps have been created from survey results completed by bilingual teachers in 61 out of 68 Yup’ik villages. While the respective points may be the same in size, this does not reflect the population density: some villages can have less than fifty speakers while others have populations up to a thousand. 
Please note: The letters correspond to the map's original image. Thus, in this map, A stands for <i>manik</i>, B stands for <i>peksuq</i>, and C stands for <i>kayanguq</i>. 
For the Yup’ik item—<i>Egg</i>-Jacobson notes that the distribution of <i>peksuq </i>and <i>kayanguq</i> represents the core vs. peripheral GCY theme. When <i>kayanguq</i> is used in some areas for ‘egg’, <i>peksuq</i> is used in the verb form <i>peksute- </i> ‘to find eggs’ (<i>+te-</i> is the postbase ‘to catch, get’).  Furthermore, Jacobson also points out that <i>manik</i> is presented in the derived form <i>manignaq</i> ‘burbot, loshe’ with postbase <i>+naq</i> ‘animal, especially fish,’ and is found only in extreme north of Yup’ik and almost pan-Eskimo outside of Yup’ik.

He also notes that Norton Sound  Unaliq uses <i>cayit</i> because “one gets (voiced) <i>s</i> when germinated intervocallically and <i>usuuq</i> because one gets (voiced) <i>s</i> when germinated”. <i>y</i> in Nunivak intervocallically one when ungerminated only and voiceless <i>s</i> when germinated.  Therefore, <i>usuuq</i> is pronounced as <i>ussuur</i>. Finally he points out  the evident <i>s</i> pattern that <i>casit</i> but  uyuuq from Marshall, Holy Cross and Kalskag is due to “deeply” followed by <i>i</i> in core GCY, but unlike core GCY “deep” germination does not cause voiced <i>s</i>.

For the Yup’ik item—<i>I ate it</i>—Jacobson discusses that the item assesses whether the past transitive (at least for the indicative) is with the postbase <i>–llru-</i> or <i>–lqe-</i>. Norton Sound Unaliq uses neither base, rather past (for intransitive and transitive) is expressed throughout context. <i>–llru-</i>, used for past transitive, is an innovation because it contains the postbase <i>~:(ng)u-</i> ‘to be’ that usually takes intransitive endings. He suggests that the use of <i>–lqe-</i> instead of <i>–llru-</i> for transitive in Upper Kuskokwim may be the “evidence for E.W. Nelson version of the Aglurmiu hypothesis”. He also notes that in <i>nerellruaqa</i> for ‘I ate it’ areas one can use <i>nerelqaqa</i> with subtle difference, ‘it’s the thing I ate’.

He notes that the divergent dialects of Yup’ik (except Norton Sound) and Alutiiq have compression, and this supports the Aglurmiut hypothesis. Scammon Bay and its neighboring Hooper Bay- Chevak have compression in common in other respects (see MY HOUSE & ITS WATER etc.). he also suggests that the compression in the upper Kuskowkim  may be a convergent development and may support the E.W.

Both the regularized form (used often by the young people) and the traditional form are found on Nelsion Is, the Canineq area, and Bristol Bay.

The cognate of <i>qavcik</i>, which means ‘wolverine’, is found in all Eskimo languages north of Yup’ik, while cognates of <i>terikaniaq</i>, which means ‘arctic fox’, is found in North Alaskan, Canadian and Greenlandic Inupiaq or Inuit. It is worthy to note that the Yup’ik for ‘marten’ is <i>qavcicuaq</i>, the literal meaning of which is ‘small wolverine’.

    <description>The Linguistic Survey of India (LSI) was a survey of the languages of British India, conducted in the first several decades of the 20th century by the British Raj and directed by Irish linguist George A Grierson. This particular map shows the Siamese-Chinese languages in what was then India and Burma.
<p>
On LSI maps of language families, such as this one, it is not always clear or consistent whether names refer to <i>languages</i> or <i>subgroups</i>. In our digitized versions, we have included the maximal language coding possible (i.e. if a name could refer to either a language or a subgroup, we include codes for both).
<p>
Note for reading these maps: The original LSI maps do not indicate boundaries or areas for all languages/dialects. This is why some language/dialect names appear simply as labels, while others appear as areas. That is, these two categories of labels are not meaningfully different (i.e. they do not represent different subgroups or anything similar) unless the legend specifically indicates otherwise.</description>
    <related>This is a language family map. LL-MAP has digitized LSI maps for the following other language families, which you may want to overlay on this map for a more complete picture:

The first pattern is used by older speakers and the second younger speakers reported by the four villages in the Bethel area.

    <description>This map shows Jacobson's overall conclusions as to the locations of the various Central Alaskan Yup'ik dialects and subdialects, as well as some of the other regions to which he refers throughout the Study. Please note that rivers and villages are part of this map, but have been turned off in the default view to avoid clutter; if you would like to view them, click the appropriate boxes in the legend.
<p>
Several important features of this map require some explanation:
- The apportionment of land to different dialects is not especially meaningful; the purpose of the map is to show which villages are in which areas. For instance, the Norton Sound Kotlik subdialect consists only of the village of Kotlik; the two-dimensional area it encompasses is presumably for graphical convenience.
- The ""transitional zones"" indicate regions in which speakers cannot be definitively classified into either of the adjacent dialects.
- The ""special areas"" are not dialects, but they are linguistically significant groupings, in which ""a number of lexical (and to a lesser extent, phonological) features cut across dialect and subdialect boundaries.""
- On the original map, Jacobson divides the Kuskokwim and Yukon rivers into lower, middle, and upper regions, with approximate boundaries. These do not represent linguistically differentiated areas, but are useful for making geographic reference to certain places throughout the Atlas. These boundaries have been left off this map for the sake of space, but you may view them by clicking the original image link.
<p>
Finally, Jacobson also points out that his dialect areas correspond very little to maps of Yup'ik ""tribes"" produced by other scholars (and generally calls into question the validity of the concept of ""tribes"" with respect to the Yup'ik).</description>

The author suggests that <i>yaamaq</i> in Egegik and Alutiiq is possibly a cognate. <i>Teggalquq/ tegalquq</i> is from <i>tegg</i>- ‘to be hard’, and the voiced <i>g</i> in the second variant is regular compared to <i>kegluneq</i> ‘wolf’ and <i>keglerluku</i> ‘taking quite  a bite out of it’, from <i>kegge-</i> ‘to bite’. SLIPPING is a similar case found in Hooper Bay-Chevak and upper Kuskokwim.

    <description>This map comes from a series of individual maps of Yup'ik dialect differences. The distribution maps have been created from survey results completed by bilingual teachers in 61 out of 68 Yup’ik villages. While the respective points may be the same in size, this does not reflect the population density: some villages can have less than fifty speakers while others have populations up to a thousand. 
Please note: The letters correspond to the map's original image. Thus, in this map, A stands for <i>pengraliq</i>, and B stands for <i>tulimaq</i>, C stands for <i>tulimaraq</i>, and D stands for <i>inarun</i>.  
For the Yup’ik item—<i>Rib</i>—Jacobson notes that the general Eskimo word for ‘rib’ in Yup’ik-- tulimaq/ tulimaraq-- is the core GCY word. The peripheral GCY word <i>inarun</i> literally means ‘device for lying down’ and “is similar to the various instrumentals used as substitutes for anatomical terms in core GCY” according to the author. <i>Pengraliq</i>—the Norton Sound Unaliq word-- occurs down in Alutiiq and may from <i>pere</i>- ‘to bend’ and the stative postbase <i>–nga-</i>.

For the Yup’ik item—<i>Sticking up for him</i>—Jacobson discusses whether the intervocalic <i>g</i> in the verb base <i>igur-</i> ‘to stick up for, to defend verbally’ has been deleted to form <i>*iur-</i> and therefore <i>eyur-</i>. He argues that the four divergent dialects use the older form and kept <i>g</i>, but scattered GCY villages also use this form and sometimes as the only form. One can compare this item to the intervocalic <i>v</i> in SONG.

For the Yup’ik item—<i>Stove</i>—Jacobson notes that <i>pelit'aaq</i> and <i>kaminiaq</i> are the two most common Yup’ik words coming from Russian (like the device itself). It is common to use two Russian loans for the same thing (see HORSE).The familiar north vs. south distribution pattern hold for the two words, illustrating that the underlying pattern was kept after Russians came. <i>Pelit'aaq</i> and <i>kaminiaq</i> are from traditional dual purpose stove for heating and cooking. The term <i>kenircuun</i> refers to a stove used for cooking only and is also used for ‘campstove’. The native words <i>keńervik</i> and <i>kenirvik</i> literally mean ‘place for fire’ and ‘place to cook’ respectively.

For the Yup’ik item—<i>Thinking</i>—Jacobson addresses some important factors the items illustrate. Firstly, he notes the use of (voiced) <i>s</i>&nbsp rather than <i>y</i>&nbsp in Norton Sound, and the retention of intervocalic <i>g</i> in Norton Sound Unaliq, Hooper Bay- Chevak, and Egegik. Secondly, he points out that the differing postbase are used to expand the basic word <i>umyu(g)aq/ umsu(g)aq</i>. Finally, he suggests that Hooper Bay-Chevak and Egegik using the same form supports the Aglurmiut hypothesis.

For the Yup’ik item—<i>When he saw me</i>—Jacobson notes that <i>1st contemporative mood</i>&nbsp ‘when one –ed’ is an Yup'ik innovation and only found in Yup’ik. Derived from the localis due to its localis ending <i>ni</i>&nbsp on intransitive forms such as <i>qavallem<u>ni</u></i>&nbsp ‘when I slept’ (compare <i>quavarpailegma</i> ‘before I slept’), <i>ni</i>&nbsp is also found between the subject and object markers of transitive forms with a 4th person subject such as <i>tangllermi<u>ni</u>a</i> ‘when he (subject) saw me’. As the map indicates, <i>ni</i>&nbsp in transitive forms with a 3rd or 2nd person singular subject is used primarily in the central coastal region. Areas using <i>tangellra<u>ni</u>a</i> instead of <i>tangellranga</i> also says <i>tangllerpe<u>ni</u>u</i> instead of <i>tangllerpegu</i> as elsewhere for ‘when you saw him’. Finally, the author points out that the same remnant of localis is used with the 2nd contemporative mood (‘while one –s’). Therefore, <i>tangva(gng)inanra<u>ni</u>q</i> and <i>tangva(gng)inanerpe<u>ni</u>u</i> are used instead of <i>tangva(gng)inanranga</i> and <i>tangva(gng)inanerpegu</i> for ‘while he was watching me’ and ‘while you were watching him’.

    <description>This map comes from a series of individual maps of Yup'ik dialect differences. The distribution maps have been created from survey results completed by bilingual teachers in 61 out of 68 Yup’ik villages. While the respective points may be the same in size, this does not reflect the population density: some villages can have less than fifty speakers while others have populations up to a thousand. 
Please note: The letters correspond to the map's original image. Thus, in this map, A stands for <i>itresqaa</i> while B stands for <i>itesqaa</i>. 
For the Yup’ik item—<i>(He) asks her to enter—</i>Jacobson notes the suffixation pattern. The first pattern, :(e)sqe- is subject to intervocalic velar dropping while the second pattern –sqe- is consonant dropping. The first pattern is used by older speakers and is probably the original. The second is used by younger speakers and is probably an innovation. 
The table below shows Non-Yup'ik Languages that also share items of Yup'ik, the letters corresponding to the note above. The ones with an asterisk mean that there is no data found for the language.

For the Yup’ik item—<i>Regularly he uses it</i> —Jacobson discusses the postbase meaning ‘to regularly-‘ that whether it retains or deletes final consonants of verb bases. The result shows north vs. south pattern. He also notes that <i>–tu-</i> is used instead of the postbase in Nunivak and Hooper Bay- Chevak, and is also used in the places where <i>+lar-/-lar-</i> is possible.

For the Yup’ik item—<i>Ruff for parka hood</i>—Jacobson notes the north vs. south pattern and suggests  a  core GCY naming taboo because <i>negiliq</i> (<i>negiqliq</i> sic) is a personal name in that region, and  <i>asguruaq</i> is a descriptive term meaning ‘similar to, or pretend, going against the (wind) current.’ <i>Ulganaq</i>, the Nunivak word, is related to <i>uulegte-</i> ‘to shake, tremble’. The localism <i>pugyaraq</i>, from <i>puge-</i> ‘to surface’, refers to the way one’s head surfaces through a parka ruff. The author also notes the Chevak form <i>legiliq</i> of <i>negiliq</i>, ""is the opposite situation from Nunivak having <i>luussiq</i> for KNIFE where others have <i>nuussiq</i>"".

The author suggests that Aleut loan words in Yup’ik pre-dates Russian times and could be due to “hunting/fishing based word taboo” since these loan words are often animal names such as <i>cagiq/sagiq</i> ‘flounder’, <i>qakiiyaq</i> ‘silver salmon’, and etc.

Also, there are other similar cases where “Unaliq (or northern Yup’ik in general) use the same word with Inupiaq bypassing Asiatic Eskimo (see example FISH SCALE)”. From this, the author argues that there is no such “a simple linear gradient runs from Kuskokwim Central Yup’ik though Yukon, Unaliq, Asiatic Eskimo and then on to Inupiaq”. Finally, he points out that <i>caqun</i> (literally ‘wrapping’) is more widespread than reported place, and also “Barnum’s 1901 grammar mentions it and was primarily on Nelson Is and the areas to the north of it.”

Jacobson points out that neither of these two post-contact bases is borrowed from Russian. The distribution of the usage of the bases for ‘writing’ is similar to that for HORSE and STOVE, which is a typical north vs. south pattern. In contrast, however, both HORSE and STOVE are Russian loan words.

Please note: The letters correspond to the map's original image. Thus, in this map, A stands for <i>kiugia</i> while B stands for <i>kiunga</i>. 
Jacobson notes that there are two forms of ‘you to me’ optative ending with verb bases which end in two vowels. For instance, the verb base for <i>kiu</i>- (‘to answer’) ends with two vowels. The two forms for the optative <i>kiu</i>- are: <i>kiugia</i> and <i>kiunga</i>. Jacobson also points out that both the two forms are used in most areas. However, only the usage of <i>Kiunga</i> is found in the following areas: most of the greater Bristol Bay area, the upper Kuskokwim and upriver Yukon, and most parts of the divergent dialects. Thus, according to Jacobson, <i>kiunga</i> is the original form from which <i>kiugia</i> derives.

The Senufo or Senufic languages (Senoufo in Francophone usage) comprise ca. 15 languages spoken by the Senufo in the north of Ivory Coast, the south of Mali and the southwest of Burkina Faso. An isolated language, Nafaanra, is also spoken in the west of Ghana. The Senufo languages are generally considered a branch of the Gur sub-family of Niger–Congo languages. Garber (1987) estimates the total number of Senufos at some 1.5 million; the Ethnologue, based on various population estimates, counts 2.7 million. The Senufo languages are bounded to the west by Mande languages, to the south by Kwa languages, and to the north and east by Central Gur languages.
The maps with different individual Senufo languages highlighted may be found at their respective webpages:

    <description>This map comes from a series of individual maps of Yup'ik dialect differences. The distribution maps have been created from survey results completed by bilingual teachers in 61 out of 68 Yup’ik villages. While the respective points may be the same in size, this does not reflect the population density: some villages can have less than fifty speakers while others have populations up to a thousand. 
Please note: The letters correspond to the map's original image. Thus, in this map, A stands for <i>ivsuk</i>, B stands for <i>ivyuk</i>, C stands for <i>cellalluk</i>, and D stands for <i>ellalluk</i>.  
For the Yup’ik item—<i>Rain</i>—Jacobson discusses the distribution of <i>ivyuk/ivsuk</i> and <i>cellalluk/ ellalluk</i> following the coast vs. inland pattern far to south to Nelson Is. Regarding the question of <i>y</i> vs. <i>s</i>, surprisingly Nelson Is uses <i>ivsuk</i> instead of <i>ivyuk</i> which is very unusual for this area. So the author speculates that <i>ivsuk</i> is “a back formation from the verb <i>ivsir-</i> ‘to rain’ where the <i>i</i> would govern the choice of <i>y</i> or <i>s</i>”.  He also points out that cognates of <i>ivyuk/ivsuk</i> is unusual in other Eskimo languages too. One can see WEATHER to address the question of initial <i>c</i> in <i>cellalluk/ellalluk</i>.

For the Yup’ik item—<i>School</i>—Jacobson notes the Yup’ik based words for ‘school’:  <i>naaqivik</i>&nbsp literally means ‘place to read’ and <i>elitnaurvik/ elicarvik/ elissarvik</i>&nbsp ‘place to endeavor to learn’. <i>(E)skuulaq</i>&nbsp and <i>(e)skuuluq</i>&nbsp are from Russian and reinforced by English”.

For the Yup’ik item—<i>Skin boot, ""mukluk""</i>--Jacobson notes that the words here are the general form because one can find special words for specific type of skin boots in all areas. According to him, <i>kamguk</i> and <i>kamesak</i> are from “the unattested (in Yup’ik) <i>*kamek</i>, cognate to the word for ‘skin boot’ in all Eskimo languages north of Yup’ik”. A cognate of <i>piluguk</i> is found only in Siberian Yup’ik where it means ‘clothing’. <i>Ac'iqaq</i>, the Nunivak form, is from <i>at’e-</i> ‘to put on clothes’. <i>Piluguk</i> is the taller boot than <i>kamesak</i> in areas where both <i>kamesak</i> and <i>piluguk</i> are used.

For the Yup’ik item—<i>Slipping</i>—Jacobson discusses the four  variants  of one basic form which is unpredictable regarding to the dialects in which they occur. He notes that the form and its distribution of  <i>ug͡asqilluni</i> are interesting because very few words start with <i>ug͡ </i> “JACKRABBIT” is one). Also, this form is one of a small number of forms used only in the middle and upper Kuskokwim, upriver Yukon and sometimes the Lake Iliamna area (PIKE FISH is another). Finally the author points out that Egegik form is also found in Nunivak and Newtok which supports the Aglurmiut hypothesis.

    <description>This map comes from a series of individual maps of Yup'ik dialect differences. The distribution maps have been created from survey results completed by bilingual teachers in 61 out of 68 Yup’ik villages. While the respective points may be the same in size, this does not reflect the population density: some villages can have less than fifty speakers while others have populations up to a thousand. 
Please note: The letters correspond to the map's original image. Thus, in this map, A stands for <i> piituq</i> while B stands for <i>cataituq</i>. 
For the Yup’ik item—<i>(He) isn't around</i>—Jacobson discusses the idiomatic meaning of these two verbs. <i>Piituq</i> literally means ‘he doesn't have a/the thing’, and the use of <i>piituq</i> for ‘he is not around, is absent’, dates back to proto-Eskimo. <i>Cataituq</i> literally means ‘there isn't anything’, and the use is only in Yup’ik.  
The table below shows Non-Yup'ik Languages that also share items of Yup'ik, the letters corresponding to the note above. The ones with an asterisk mean that there is no data found for the language.

For the Yup’ik item—<i>I also talked about them</i>—Jacobson discusses the deletion of the <i>e</i> in an open syllable where if it is not a full vowel, “it would be rhythmically lengthened.” He notes that <i>e</i> is not deleted in Norton Sound Unaliq, “rather the following consonant (k in this case) is germinated thus closing the syllable”. According to the author, <i>e</i> is deleted in peripheral GCY; “the preceding vowel gets the stress that <i>e</i> would have had, and rhythmic stress assignment proceeds from there”. Also, <i>e</i> is deleted in core GCY, “and the word is re-evaluated for rhythmic stress just as if the <i>e</i> had never been there” which is the most extreme pattern according to Jacobson.

For the Yup’ik item—<i>Laughing</i>—Jacobson suggests that <i>englarluni</i> is the original form for ‘laughing’ according to comparative evidence and becomes <i>ngel'arluni</i> (underlying form <i>[e]nglarluni</i>) elsewhere in Yup’ik. He also notes that <i>nel'arluni</i> and <i>el'arluni</i> are derived from <i>ngel'arluni</i> because they do not use <i>ng</i> as words initial. According to the author, the initial <i>n</i> on <i>nenglarluni</i> may be “a parallel independent innovation” regarding to Siberian Yup’ik. Also, the initial <i>n</i> in the Egegik area and the upper Kuskokwim may support the E.W. Nelson version of the Aglurmiut hypothesis.

The word <i>ungilak</i>, a direct nominalization of <i>ungilag</i> – 'to itch', is limited to the very core of core GCY.

Looking at other Eskimo languages, it appears that <i>qup’luq/quvluq</i> is the pan-Eskimo word for 'maggot'. <i>Paraluq</i> has no cognates outside of Yup’ik, and it is not so common to encounter a substitute Yup’ik word used in all the areas where <i>paraluq</i> is used.

He points out that <i>ari-</i>&nbsp means ‘to get mashed’ in Yup’ik and ‘to become wet’ outside of Yup’ik, and neither fits the meaning ‘mitten’. <i>Aliuman</i>&nbsp may literally mean ‘device to be, in an extended sense, a sleeve (<i>aliq</i>)’, which fits the meaning ‘mitten’ and <i>aliiman</i>&nbsp can be a variant. <i>Kauman</i>&nbsp literally ‘device to plunge one’s hand into’, is restricted to the Nelson Is. and Canineq.

For the Yup’ik item—<i>My house & its water</i>—Jacobson discusses whether the items does or does not have “weak” initial <i>e</i> on certain words. In Nunivak <i>ena</i> ‘house’ and <i>emeq</i> ‘water’ do not have weak initial <i>e</i>. Therefore, one says <i>enka</i> ‘my house’, <i>enliut</i> ‘they are making a house’, <i>emra</i> ‘its water’ or homophonously ‘drink’, <i>emliraa</i> ‘he diluted it’, etc.  According to the author, in Hooper Bay- Chevak, Scammon Bay, and Egegik the initial <i>e</i> in <i>ena</i> is not weak except [e]meq. Therefore, one pronounces <i>enka</i>, <i>enliut</i>, <i>mer’a</i>, and <i>mel’iraa</i> for the same items. The initial <i>e</i> is weak in both <i>[e]na</i> and <i>[e]meq</i> in the rest of Yup’ik, so one says <i>nek’a</i>, <i>neliut</i>, <i>mer’a</i>, and <i>mel’iraa</i> for the same items.  Finally, he points out that the initial <i>e</i> of ‘house’ and ‘water’ is audible only in words such <i>enii</i> ‘his house’ and <i>emiumauq</i> ‘it has been diluted’ (from <i>[e]meliumauq</i>).

For the Yup’ik item—<i>(River) otter</i>—Jacobson discusses the items that shows the common north vs. south pattern with four zones. <i>Pirtuciraq</i> (sic.) in the northernmost part of Yup’ik ""is as in Eskimo to the north"". The author argues that the division between <i>cenkaq/cinkaq</i> (the variation is predictable) and <i>cuignilnguq</i> is ""not quite a horizontal line because upriver Yukon goes along with the Kuskokwim.” One can see the opposite situation in WHITEFISH. He points out that in the south <i>aaquyaq</i> in Egegik is as in Alutiiq. Also, <i>pirtuciraq</i> (sic.) occurs in Egegik but not found in Alutiiq, and one can see a similar situation in LOUSE. Finally, he notes that in Norton Sound which lacks stress retraction, the word is pronounced <i>pírtucîraq</i> but <i>pírtúrciraq</i> in Egegik.

Also, a big part of Yup'ik uses <i>cikigpak</i> (literally ‘big <i>cikik</i>’) for ‘marmot’. <i>Uiq</i> (the second word for marmot) appears scarcely in the lower Kuskokwim and Bristol Bay and could be the cognate to <i>qusXiq</i> or <i>quiXiq</i> ‘marmot’ in Alutiiq. The author argues that marmots are uncommon in many places, so they have no word for this.

    <description>This map comes from a series of individual maps of Yup'ik dialect differences. The distribution maps have been created from survey results completed by bilingual teachers in 61 out of 68 Yup’ik villages. While the respective points may be the same in size, this does not reflect the population density: some villages can have less than fifty speakers while others have populations up to a thousand. 
Please note: The letters correspond to the map's original image. Thus, in this map, A stands for <i>ek'rarluku</i>, B stands for <i>kerarluku</i>, C stands for <i>ker'arluku</i>, D stands for <i>qerarluku</i>, E stands for <i>qer'arluku</i>, and F stands for <i>qerrarluku</i>.   
For the Yup’ik item—<i>Crossing it</i>--Jacobson notes that <i>arvir- </i>is used in and around Nelson Is, upper Kuskokwim, and upriver Yukon. <i>Nirar-</i>&nbsp is used in Nushagak and Lake Iliamna area, and <i>qerar- </i>&nbspand its variants elsewhere. The options of <i>k</i> (Yukon) or <i>q</i> (elsewhere) in <i>qerar-/kerar-</i>&nbsp follows the same pattern of <i>qiuryaq/kiuryaq</i>&nbsp ‘aurora’. He also notes that the forms of <i>qerar-/kerar-</i>&nbsp “with germinated or voiceless<i> r</i>&nbsp are local variants,” and “<i>ek'rar</i>&nbsp in Nunivak and Egegik is closer to the forms used in Inupiaq and Alutiiq.”

For the Yup’ik item—<i>(Being)sick</i>—Jacobson notes the item showing twice the north vs. south pattern. The northern part of Yup’ik uses <i>nangte(qe)-</i> “like adjoining Inupiaq”. <i>Naulluu-</i> is used in the middle part and <i>qena-</i> is used in the southern part also like “adjoining Alutiiq.” <i>Nangte(qe)-</i> (from <i>nange-</i> ‘to be depleted’) means ‘to suffer’ in areas  using <i>naulluu-</i> or <i>qena-</i> for ‘to be sick.’ The author suggests that <i>naulluu-</i> may mean ‘to be (a) <i>naulluuk</i>’ where <i>naulluuk</i> would mean ‘(one with) bad vegetative grown.’

    <description>Map 65 shows the locations of three different words in Sorbian dialects meaning '<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaff"">chaff</a>' (Ger. <i>Häcksel</i>). The primary Sorbian word derives from proto-Slavic <i>*sěk</i>. In the western and middle portions of the Hoyerswarda dialect, a form stemming from <i>rěz</i> is observed, while in the far northwestern part of the language area, a loan from German is used.</description>

    <description>Map 22 of the series describes the Sorbian forms of a word translated by the authors as Ger. <i>Ähre</i> which can be interpreted as an ear of grain, or the type of structure the head of a particular variety of grain has. Notably, north of the main isogloss line in this map, the masculine form of the Sorbian root is most common, while south of this line, the feminine form dominates local speech.</description>
