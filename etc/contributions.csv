He states that the hypothesis best supported by current linguistic and archaeological research is that the proto-Austronesians migrated out of mainland China around 4000 BC and across the Taiwan Strait into Taiwan.  From there, they migrated south through the Philippines, resulting in the formation of the Malayo-Polynesian subgroup.  Over time, they continued to migrate further east and west, and advancements in maritime technology allowed the Austronesians to spread out across the Pacific and Indian oceans, reaching such far-flung locations as Rapa Nui (Easter Island) in the Pacific and Madagascar in the Indian (Bellwood 2006).

Canada may be divided into six broad Aboriginal cultural areas based on major geographic regions. Tribes in the same region share a greater number of cultural affinities than tribes from different regions. However only in the Arctic do the lines of geography, language and culture coincide so closely. Nunavutâs boundary strongly reflects that of the cultural zone of the Aboriginal people of the Eastern Arctic. The Inuit are descendants of the Thule, who came from Asia and lived in the Arctic for thousands of years. Their language, Inuktitut, is spoken by most of the population.
This map illustrates the six major aboriginal cultural areas of Canada. Notice that the Nunavut boundary closely reflects that of the cultural zone of the people of the Eastern Arctic. The Inuit also live in the northern regions of the Northwest Territories, northern Quebec and Labrador. The spoken language, Inuktitut, is limited to Nordic regions, while the other native cultural areas of Canada are much more heterogeneous.
The Arctic, characterized by its cold environment and scarce resources, has produced a highly specialized culture which was centred primarily on the hunt for seals and other marine mammals in coastal regions and caribou in inland areas west of Hudson Bay. Small, widely dispersed bands of hunters have traditionally followed seasonal migration patterns in search of these prey.

""Proto-Maya, the common ancestor of all Maya tongues, was probably spoken in west-central Guatemala, 
around the highland pine-oak forests of the Cuchumatanes mountain chain: north of the Motagua and Grijalva river valleys, 
through patches of cloud forest, and down to the edge of the tropical forest lowlands near the Ixcán and Chixoy (Negro) rivers, 
which flow into the Usumacinta River (Campbell and Kaufman, p. 191). Evidence that this region was the Maya ""heartland"" include
 its being located near the center of present-day language diversity within the Maya phylum (and therefore requiring the minimum
 number of moves to place the languages in their current locations), the fact that proto-Maya included words for flora and fauna 
 from both highland and lowland areas, and the debatable idea that it is easier for a group of people to spread from a highland 
 region to a lowland one than vice-versa (Dahlin, p. 370). (...)  Whether the proto-Huastecs split from the rest of the Maya in 
 2200 or in 1200 BCE, the separation occurred at least a millennium before the rise of classic Maya culture. (...)
 If we consider 2000 BCE as a reasonable date for the Huastec/Maya split, and the slopes of the Cuchumatanes range as a 
 reasonable location for the speakers of proto-Maya, it seems likely that the split occurred after these proto-Maya speakers 
 (or a portion of them) began to migrate north, probably along the Usumacinta River, and before the two groups resulting from 
 the split began to move in opposite directions: the proto-Huastec speakers moving northwest (and, soon thereafter, 
 the proto-Chicomuceltec west into the Chiapas highlands), and the proto-Yucatec/other Maya-speakers spreading northeast 
 (one branch of which became Chontal, presumed by many from its widespread loan words and hieroglyphic evidence to be the
 dominant language of the classic Peten Maya heartland). While we have no direct archaeological evidence to explain the split 
 itself, we can assume by linguistic evidence that contact was soon cut off between the two groups, despite there being no 
 geographical feature that would automatically isolate them from each other.""

Additional remarks from the legend: 
Figures for 1964 are derived from <i>Atlas narodov Mira</i> (Moscow 1964), p.20. Figures for Peisan and Azeri include the speakers of all their dialects listed separately in the Atlas. 
Figures for 2006 are extrapolated from similar cases where the society shows comparable rates of fast urbanization, education and wealth generation with more reliable and available data than Iran.
Many more people speak Persian as their first language today than did two generations ago. Heavy migration into the cities, mass education and electronic media have all helped in linguistic assimilation of many an Iranian minority member. While, e.g., around 19% of the Iranians are ethnic Azeris, only around 13% speak Azeri as their first language. Meanwhile, the percentage of those speaking Persian as their first language, may now be not much less than the 68% claimed by the Iranian census of 2001.",,"[Linguistic Composition of Iran](http://gulf2000.columbia.edu/images/maps/Iran_Languages_lg.jpg)",LinguisticIran/LinguisticIran.jpg,,"Dr. M.

11787,Bureau of Indian Affairs Reservations (BIARes),Indian Lands of the United States,,,"## Abstract:
      This map layer shows Indian lands of the United States.  Only areas of 640 
      acres or more are included.  Federally-administered lands within a 
      reservation are included for continuity; these may or may not be 
      considered part of the reservation and are simply described with their 
      feature type and the administrating Federal agency.  This is an updated 
      version of the December 2004 map layer.
    ## Purpose:
      These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the 
      national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be 
      displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale 
      data.  No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United 
      States in the use of these data.

    ## National Atlas Process description
        Working in Arc/INFO, Indian reservations and Federal lands internal 
        to them were extracted from the National Atlas Federal Lands map 
        layer.  Isolated features under 640 acres were deleted. Attributes for 
        feature type, name, administering agency, State, and State FIPS codes 
        were retained.  Adjacent Indian reservations having the same feature 
        type, name, and administering agency were merged.  State attributes of 
        merged Indian reservations were then updated.  Names for non-Indian 
        lands were deleted.  For polygons without label points, the points were

For the Yup’ik item—<i>Person</i>——Jacobson discusses the two variants of <i>yuk</i>: one is <i>suk</i> in some areas on the Yukon which “is the result of a universal change of initial <i>y</i> to voiceless <i>s</i>,” and therefore <i>suk, sukutaq</i> ‘moisture’ and <i>saani</i>  ‘over there’—corresponding to <i>yuk, yukutq,</i> and <i>yaani</i> in most Yup’ik; the other variant is <i>cuk</i> in Chevak and Nunivak which is because “these places have initial <i>c</i> where other places have <i>y</i> but only when followed by a single vowel”, therefore <i>cuk, cukutaq</i>, but <i>yaani</i> not <i>*caani</i>.

Alutiiq follows the Chevak-Nunivak pattern with <i>s</i> instead of <i>c</i>, and not the Yukon <i>s</i> pattern, given <i>suk, sukutaq</i> but <i>yaani</i> not <i>*saani</i>. Finally, <i>taru</i> is a Alutiiq word.

<i>Excerpt from Hua'er meetings: dialogic song during pilgrimage (full text can be found in 'other LLMAP resources' below):</i
Hua'er (Mandarin Chinese Huā'ér 花儿) is a Pan-Ethnic Chinese-language dialogic song form that is performed largely in spontaneous festivals on holy mountaintops and other sites in Amdo (Northern Tibet). These annual events attract 100-40,000 people from many ethnic groups--the Amdo Tibetans, Muslim and Han Chinese, Salars, and Monguors--and they cluster around the summer solstice.

	These hua'er ""meetings"" 花儿会, as they are known, are concentrated where the loess plains of western China meet the Tibetan plateau in northeastern Tibet, primarily in what is today southern Gansu province and southeastern Qinghai province, but also in Ningxia and Xinjiang.
The first day, or part of the first day, is devoted to prayers for auspicious events: young couples pray for the birth of a son, farmers pray for a lack of crop-destroying hailstorms and a good harvest. Depending on the site, prayers and offerings may be made at Buddhist or Daoist temples both large and small, situated in a choice location at the sacred site. If the sacred site is a mountain, then one or more temples are located at the foot of the mountain, along heavily-travelled paths partway up, and/or at various summits with commanding vistas.

361190,Yup'ik Dialect Atlas and Study: CHEWING GUM,,,,"This map comes from a series of individual maps of Yup'ik dialect differences. The distribution maps have been created from survey results completed by bilingual teachers in 61 out of 68 Yup’ik villages. While the respective points may be the same in size, this does not reflect the population density: some villages can have less than fifty speakers while others have populations up to a thousand. 
Please note: The letters correspond to the map's original image. Thus, in this map, A stands for <i>kuc'uq</i>, while B stands for <i>angeq</i>. 
For the Yup’ik item—<i>Chewing gum</i>—Jacobson notes both words <i>kuc'uq</i> and <i>angeq</i> used for ‘chewing gum’ have the original meaning of ‘spruce pitch.’ <i>Kuc’uq</i> may be used in the Lake Iliamna area and possibly have a cognate in Alutiiq. <i>Kuc'uq</i> is possibly a loan from Inupiaq and used in Norton Sound and the Yukon.

The author argues that this localism is not an old one because of the modern instrumental postbase <i>-cuun/-ssuun</i> that appears to have replaced <i>–(u)n</i> and is now non-productive. He notes that words for ‘pencil’ use both postbase and words for pre-contact device use only the older postbase.

While the respective points may be the same in size, this does not reflect the population density: some villages can have less than fifty speakers while others have populations up to a thousand. 
Please note: The letters correspond to the map's original image. Thus, in this map, A stands for <i>asaun</i>, B stands for <i>ayaun</i>, C stands for <i>nangneq</i>, and D stands for <i>kumluq</i>.  
For the Yup’ik item—<i>Thumb</i>—Jacobson notes that <i>kumluq</i> is the Yup’ik form of an almost pan-Eskimo word for ‘thumb’, and <i>ayaun</i> is almost a typical core GCY innovation (compare ELBOW and TONGUE) except for its surprising occurrence (predictably as <i>asaun</i>) in Mt. Village and Norton Sound Unaliq (see also BECAUSE I LEFT). Instead of being derived from the verb base <i>ayag-</i> ‘to leave’, <i>ayaun/ asaun</i> is from the root <i>ayag-</i> that deals with ‘supporting leaning’. <i>Nangneq</i> literally ‘the last one’ is found in Nunivak and Chugach Alutiiq which is the evidence of the part of the Aglurmiut hypothesis that links Nunivak and Alutiiq. 
The table below shows Non-Yup'ik Languages that also share items of Yup'ik, the letters corresponding to the note above. The ones with an asterisk mean that there is no data found for the language.

The Salars are most likely Oğuz-Turkic speakers who migrated from Transoxiana to Amdo Tibet in the 13th century. Settling on the banks of the Yellow River in what is today Qinghai province, they intermarried with Tibetans and later Muslim Chinese, incorporating many elements of these groups into their culture and language. Today, the Salars number over 90,000, but their unwritten language is rapidly giving way to the dominant languages, particularly to Chinese (Dwyer 2000).
The Salars are one of ethnic groups (along with Amdo Tibetans, Muslim Han Chinese, and Monguors) that participate in Hua'er(Mandarin Chinese Huā'ér 花儿), a Pan-Ethnic Chinese-language dialogic song form that is performed largely in spontaneous festivals on holy mountaintops and other sites in Amdo (Northern Tibet). These annual events attract 100-40,000 people.

The tree-model of language relationships in Athabaskan linguistics can run into difficulties, and so this map shows the ways that the features of Proto-Athabaskan are realized in the various Athabaskan languages.
What follows is an explanation of the data we have up for display:

<dl>
<dt>A <b>series</b> refers to a set of unaspirated, aspirated, and ejective stops/affricates at the same place of articulation. This set changes as unit historically. Thus, e.g., the series *ts refers to *ts, *tsh, and *ts'</dt>

<dd>*q  --> q	k</dd>					
<dt><b>Tone</b> refers to whether the language has tone developed from Proto-Athabaskan (PA) constricted syllables</dt>
<dd>tone =  absent, vestigial, present, complex</dd>
<dt><b>Tone Value</b> refers to the pitch which is realized from PA constricted syllables</dt>
<dd>tone value =none, low, high</dd>
<dt><b>-C' zone</b> refers to the degree of reduction of PA stem-final glottalized consonants</dt>
<dd>Zones are marked as 0-4 from least to most reduced</dd>

The atlas includes the Pacific area, Southeast Asia (apart from Burma), and Madagascar.	Across the Pacific and Indian oceans, the Austronesian speaking people have voyaged for centuries making a network of communication within a linguistic family that became the most extensive in the world prior to European arrival. The cultures were launched from the Western Pacific and the early Austronesian speakers reached islands of further distance apart traveling in lashed and pegged canoes across vast expanses of ocean. The Electronic Cultural Atlas Initiative (ECAI) over the past few years has developed as a group interested in the academic research and international collaboration. The Austronesian projects were proposed by the founder and chairman of ECAI, Lewis Lancaster, at a meeting entitled Austronesian Studies in Taiwan--Retrospective and Prospect (UC Berkeley sponsored with the Shung Ye Museum in 1997). Since then collaborative teams have taken up the idea by researching the possibilities of cultural mapping using a geographic information system (GIS) to integrate the heritage of a place.This project is a model for future language mapping because it combines the generation of a digital version of older printed language maps with the collection of data on contemporary languages areas, and then the use of dynamic (time-enabled) map display techniques capable of showing visually the changes in language boundaries. The work will also give us an opportunity to advance our work on the design and use of gazetteers of language areas. A conventional gazetteer of Austronesian place-names would be supplemented (or complemented) by a directory of languages and dialects with the formal geographical specifications of where they are (or were) spoken at different times. These data would be coupled with map displays such that any combination of data from the gazetteer could be displayed at will. There are plans for a peer-reviewed digital publication in collaboration with the California Digital Library administered by the Office of the President of the University of California.",,"[	The Austronesian Team (ECAI)](http://www.ecai.org/austronesiaweb/PacificMaps.htm)",,,,Publicly Available,,,"Hsiung-ming Liao , Project Leader for GIS Team in Academia Sinica Computing Centre, Taiwan

For the Yup’ik item—<i>Housefly</i>--Jacobson argues that it is hard to determine whether or not the pronunciation supports the ""Aglurmiut hypothesis"" in Hooper Bay- Chevak & Egegik. The Nunivak word, on the other hand, is most likely related to <i> anair(aq)</i>, which means 'dung fly,' in much of the Yup'ik.

Newman suggests two reasons for some Bantu moving eastward: 1) food-producing sites might have been lacking and/or 2) the Bantu were moving due to the expansion of Ubangian peoples.

For the Yup’ik item—<i>Waiting for him</i>—Jacobson notes that <i>utaqa</i>, the general Eskimo verb base for ‘to wait’, is used almost everywhere in Yup’ik, and <i>atanqe-</i> is a synonym that appears sporadically in some places as an alternatives. The author suggests that <i>atanqe</i> may be from <i>ata-</i> ‘to be attached, dependent’ or from <i>ataneq</i> ‘master’.

The distributions maps have been created from survey results completed by bilingual teachers in 61 out of 68 Yup’ik villages. While the respective points may be the same in size, this does not reflect the population density: some villages can have less than fifty speakers while others have populations up to a thousand. 
Please note: The letters correspond to the map's original image. Thus, in this map, A stands for <i>ayagnginanemni</i> while B stands for <i>ayainanemni</i>. 
For the Yup’ik item—<i>While I was going</i>—Jacobson discusses the suffixation pattern that used with the 2nd contemporative mood. The marker is <i>+nginaner-</i> in the pattern of ayagnginanemni, while the marker is <i>(ng)inaner-</i> in the pattern of <i>ayainanemni</i>. The author suggests that people follow the first pattern would also say <i>kaiginanemni</i> for ‘while I was hungry’ and <i>qanrinanemni </i> for ‘while I was speaking’, while those who follow the second pattern would use <i>kaignginanemni</i> and <i>qanernginanemni</i> for the same. The distribution follows the common theme of  core GCY vs. peripheral GCY plus divergent dialects. BECAUSE I LEFT has the same distribution.

Since all attested Southern Nilotic languages of more northerly areas in later times show the defining sound change of proto-Southern Nilotic -- the loss of [r] before [i] in word-final syllables -- it is probable that the dialect or dialects of ancestral to proto-Southern Nilotic were spoken by people living North of the belt between Kilimanjaro and Lake Victoria. Ehret claims that the numerous Southern Nilotic loanwords sugggest the Victoria pre-Southern Nilotic population lived in the areas east and southeast from Lake Victoria. Several loanswords from pre-Southern Nilotic can also be distinguished in Bantu languages.,2009,ehret1971[41],"Nilohistory003/Nilohistory003.jpg

As he states in his book, the most influential migrations were those of the Eastern Nilotes.  Despite the characterization of their encounters with other cultures as hostile and often violent, it was more common for groups to be gradually displaced or absorbed, with some maintaining independence and coexisting.  Such was the case with the Southern Cushites, who were displaced over time, and the Kalenjins, who were assimilated into Bantu society (Newman).",2009,newman1995[171],Newman011/Newman011-004.jpg,"[Eastern and Southern Cushites Introduce Food-Producing Economies to the Interior Mosaic (Newman) ](ContributionTable#cldf:11732)

During the nineteenth century, two major events brought change once again to east Africa: the arrival of the Ngoni and the growth of the trade industries from the coast.  The Ngoni fought their way north, and many peoples fled, were destroyed or were assimilated; some stood their ground, however, and the constant turmoil that resulted prevented population increases for the rest of the century.  By contrast, the steadily improving trade markets encouraged expansion.  Arab-Swahili, Kamba and Yao traders connected the interior of the continent with the coast (Newman 1995: 175).

Despite this displacement, these groups coexisted for some time, until the arrival of European settlers pressured them to move north again.  With this reversal of directions, the Europeans created a wave of migration; the resulting clashes between the Europeans and the Bantu and multiple Bantu groups affected populations as far north as Tanzania (Newman 1995: 184-186).",,newman1995[186],Newman009/Newman009.jpg,,,,,1995,,,

In the Northern region of Africa, skeletal remains demonstrate that Cro-Magnon precursors to modern Mediterranean causaoids inhabited the area from the Lower Nile into the Maghrib. Although skeletons of tall negroids are few, those that exist exihibit characteristics of the sedentarizing lakeside and riverside peoples of the Sahara, the Sahel, the Middle Nile and Eastern Africa.

Since many Metis were nomads, they can also be found as far south as the Grand Ronde Reservation in Oregon. In spite of their lack of a common language, the Metis do indeed form an ethnic group.

110011,"Philippines: Philippine Settlement, Migrations and Contact",Philippine Migrations and Contacts,Erin,Smith,"This map reflects two contrasting scholarly hypotheses regarding migration paths and the settlement of the Philippines.  The first hypothesis states that Austronesian migrants traveled south from Taiwan through the archipelago before continuing further south through Oceania, west to Madagascar and east toward Polynesia, Rapa Nui and Hawaii.  The second, offered as an alternative by Delfin et al. (2010), states that while some groups from Taiwan clearly moved south to populate areas of the Philippines, most of the genetic affiliations observed for those living in the southern islands of the chain are shared between the majority of East Asians.  This suggests that additional populations moving from East Asia are quite likely, although further analysis on more genes would be necessary to fully support the conclusion (this study focused exclusively on the Y-chromosome).  
Focusing upon the Negrito populations of the Philippines in order to determine their origins, Delfin et al. (2010) provides strong evidence that Negrito and non-Negrito groups in the Philippines share ancestry and were likely part of the same migration, rather than Negrito populations being descendants of aboriginal peoples present at the time of Austronesian settlement.  They also observed in their study that some of the Negrito groups studied appear to share lineage with several Australian aboriginal groups, and these connections are noted on the map.",,,,,"Delfin, Frederick, Jazelyn M Salvador, Gayvelline C Calacal, Henry B Perdigon, Kristina A Tabbada, Lilian P Villamor, Saturnina C Halos, Ellen Gunnarsdottir, Sean Myles, David A Hughes, Shuhua Xu, Li Jin, Oscar Lao, Manfred Kayser, Matthew E Hurles, Mark Stoneking and Maria Corazon A De Ungria.  2010.

Their study found that both the Taiwan and Island Southeast Asian populations were more closely related to Daic than to one another, indicating that Daic is likely the ancestral group from which the others derived separate paternal lineages.  This conclusion casts doubt upon the hypothesis put forth by many historical linguists that Austronesian populations arrived at their current locations by migrating south through Taiwan; none of the haplogroup data analysed suggests that these two populations are related more closely to one another than they are to Daic, despite the linguistic similarity observed amongst speakers.

This suggests that southeastern Asia has a higher degree of genetic diversity than the northeast.  This in turn provides evidence toward the conclusion that modern East Asian populations are at least in part descended from groups that lived in this southern area.     Furthermore, these results suggest that the two-wave hypothesis for the settlement of southeast Asia and the Pacific is not accurate.  Although they state that further studies should be undertaken for verification, their current findings point toward a shared ancestry and a migration history that, ""unites the

In fact, there seems to be a relationship between both characteristics. Though the map reflects isolated cases of -s- aspiration in northern Spain, it's likely that they stem from some kind of contact with southern speakers. For most northern speakers, the -s- aspiration was a pretty sure way to detect a southerner. Today the -s- aspirating variety of the language is expanding quickly to the north in Spain.

11835,Australia: Language Locations and Tribal Groups (Dixon and Blake),Language Locations and Tribal Groups in Australia,,,"This is a compilation of six different maps showing various language locations and tribal groups in the Australia region.
		The Wargamay map displays the Wargamay language and its dialects as well as the neighboring languages. 
		According to Dixon, Wargamay, Hinchinbrook Biyay, and Halifax Biyay are all dialects of the Wargamay language. 
		He also explains that there are strong similarities between Wargamay and the bordering languages of Giramay and Nyawaygi,
		but these similarities do not suggest a ""close genetic connection"" (Dixon).
		The dialectal boundary between Biyay and Halifax Biyay are based loosely on information provided by the source. 
		The Watjarri map illustrates the Watjarri language, ""spoken by the descendants of an Aboriginal tribe previously 
		camped along a section of the Murchison River,"" and its respective neighboring languages and place names (Douglas). 
		Around these stations and towns, within the original Watjarri area, were formed dialects. Furthermore, the railway 
		allowed for influences from other surrounding languages which Douglas describes is evident in the borrowings across 
		vocabularies. The Tasmania map shows a speculative inference of the different locations of the languages and dialects 
		of Tasmania which are now extinct. 
		On the map are 15 regions to which vocabulary are assigned and cross-compared to 
		analyze the genetic relationship between the languages. Crowley and Dixon suggest that there were at least eight languages 
		within Tasmania; however, this conclusion is ""tentative"" as little data is available on many of the languages. The 
		Margany/Gunya map displays Margany and Gunya, ""the south-westernmost of the long chain of closely related dialects known 
		to (...) linguists as the Mari languages"" and other surrounding languages and place names (Breen). The Anguthimiri map 
		highlights the area of Anguthimri speaking groups as well as neighboring peoples and languages. According to Crowley, 
		Anguthimri has ""one of the most unusual phonological systems"" consisting of single-syllable words, consonant clustered
		initial syllables, and an extensive vowel system (Crowley).",2009,blake_etal1981,HALLangs/HALLangs.html,"[Aboriginal Languages of Australia: Language Families (Oates and Oates)](ContributionTable#cldf:12207)

110129,A New Hypothesis of Austronesian Expansion and Cultural Contact,A New Hypothesis of Austronesian Expansion and Cultural Contact,Erin,A.S. Crabb,"Reflected upon this map is a new hypothesis of Austronesian expansion, based upon research in linguistics, archaeology and human genetics.  The majority of current studies agree that Taiwanese peoples are related both genetically and linguistically to Austronesians now living in southeast Asia and the Pacific, and many sources agree that they probably arrived on the island from mainland China around 6000 years ago.  From this point, however, linguistic and genetic hypotheses have diverged: historical linguists and archaeologists have so far supported a model in which Austronesians migrated south through the Philippines to what is now Indonesia, spreading east and west from there.  Geneticists, however, have found that many Austronesian populations are more closely related to their mainland Asian ancestors than they are to the Taiwanese, in effect making the Taiwan aboriginal peoples and the Austronesians parallel branches from the same tree. 
Also included here are several genetic and archaeological hypotheses of cultural contact and migration, including Blench's (2010) proposal of contact with the Indian subcontinent and Delfin et al.'s (2010) genetic relations with several Australian aboriginal groups.   
Rather than viewing Austronesian expansion as a series of straightforward migrations, it seems more and more necessary to delve more deeply into the history and culture of the peoples and the area in order to better reconstruct their history.  As further research is undertaken, more of these details will come to light, allowing interdisciplinary scholars to continue improving on what seems to be a solid foundational understanding of the region and its linguistic and genetic history.",,,,"[Austronesian Migration (Cribb)](ContributionTable#cldf:109917)

Then, using statistical analysis, they analyzed the likelihood of their proposed sequence of events (in this case, the migration patterns) occurring.  Each of the circles on this map represents one of the stations compared against the language family tree.

Please note: The letters correspond to the map's original image. Thus, in this map, A stands for <i>qiini</i> and B stands for <i>qagaani</i>.
For the Yup’ik item—<i>(In the extended area) out there</i>—Jacobson discusses the item that addresses the formation of adverbs from the three demonstrative pronouns <i>agna</i> ‘that across there (extended)’, <i>pagna</i> ‘that up there (extended)’, and <i>qagna</i> ‘that out there (extended)’. The standard pattern for this adverb formation is that “the final segment <i>na</i> of the pronoun is replaced with <i>ani</i> (and similarly for case other than the localis), giving first <i>*agani,*pagani</i>, and <i>*qagani</i> (compare <i>amani</i> ‘over there (obscured)’ and then by velar-dropping and vowel-raising these become <i>iini</i> ‘across there’, <i>piini</i> ‘up there’, and <i>qiini</i> ‘out there’. While Norton Sound, Nunivak and the area where the Yukon and Kuskokwim are close together and follow this standard pattern, all the rest of Yup’ik avoid such vowel-raising and insert an extra <i>a</i> instead to give <i>aga<u>a</u>ni, paga<u>a</u>ni, and qaga<u>a</u>ni</i>. The author notes that the vowel-raising (not the velar-dropping) is “objectionable,” and therefore, from the demonstrative pronoun <i>ugna</i> ‘that toward exist (restrict)’, one gets the adverb *ugani and hence <i>uani</i> ‘toward exit’.

For the Yup’ik item—<i>Pants</i>—Jacobson notes the word for ‘pants’ which is ""shibboleth"" to distinguish Bristol Bay and Kuskokwim, and other examples are BOAT, “RABBIT”, COAT, and (BEING) SICK. Due to the use of cognates of <i>qerrulliik</i> in Eskimo languages to the north of Yup’ik and of <i>ulruk</i> in Alutiiq, the pattern can be north vs. south with the division line far to the south (COOKING is another example). FISHHOOK is a case of the division line in the middle.

The Arawak had long dominated the Greater Antilles, however, in the late period before Conquest, Arawak was threatened by the Carib from northeastern South America. Furthermore, within a century of the Spanish arrival, the number of Arawak decreased due to Spanish aggression and diseases brought from Spain. The Amazon Basin is the area of influx of many peoples, thus many languages such as Arawakan and Carib are spoken in the area. Quechua, the official language was the lingua franca of Inca Empire.

While the respective points may be the same in size, this does not reflect the population density: some villages can have less than fifty speakers while others have populations up to a thousand. 
Please note: The letters correspond to the map's original image. Thus, in this map, A stands for <i>kuveciquq</i>, B stands for <i>kuv'ciquq</i>, and C stands for <i>kuvciquq </i>.  
For the Yup’ik item—<i>It will spill</i>--Jacobson examines a “‘hatted’ <i>e</i> (an <i>e</i> which is in a position whereby were it another vowel it would be rhythmically lengthened) which arises during word construction.” An <i>e</i> is retained and the following consonant is germinated in Norton Sound Unaliq and is deleted in the rest of Yup’ik unless it is between consonants. He notes, in Hooper Bay- Chevak, in Egegik and most peripheral GCY “if deletion of a ‘hatted’ <i>e</i> causes a voiced fricative to be followed by a stop or voiceless fricative the fricative in question stays voiced (as shown by the apostrophe). In core GCY and in Nunivak if a fricative ends up being followed by a stop or voiceless fricative for that reason that the fricative in question becomes voiceless.” The author also points out that areas using <i>kuveciquq</i> would also use germinated <i>ll</i> for <i>nerelleq</i> ‘the one that ate,’ and areas using <i>kuv'ciquq</i> would say <i>ner’lleq</i>, and areas using <i>kuvciquq</i> would say <i>nerrleq</i>.

For the Yup’ik item—<i>Jumping</i>--Jacobson discusses that <i>qeckar-</i>, the most widespread Yup’ik verb base for ‘to jump’, is from <i>qeceg-</i> with a postbase meaning ‘suddenly’. The postbase has become fused to the base in many areas so <i>qeceg-</i> alone is used in certain outlying areas. He also notes that cognates of the expanded base <i>qeckar-</i> are used both to the north and south of Yup’ik. <i>Meceg-</i> is limited to the area in contact with Inupiaq.

For the Yup’ik item—<i>""Salmon berry"", cloudberry</i>—Jacobson suggests that <i>aqavsik/ aqevyik</i> is the original Yup’ik name and has cognates in other Eskimo. He also notes that this word is limited to Norton Sound Unaliq and Hooper Bay-Chevak within Yup’ik. All the words reflect the important role of this kind of berry in Yup’ik life except for <i>epulek</i> ‘one with a handle or stem' which is the descriptive Egegik localism. Finally, he points out that <i>atsaq</i> means just ‘berry’ and <i>naunraq</i> means just ‘plant’ in the areas where these words don’t mean ‘salmonberry’. <i>Atsarpiaq</i> and <i>atsalugpiaq</i> mean ‘genuine, original berry’.

According to Jacobson, the two forms for<i>Woman’s or semilunar knife</i> are <i>uluaq</i> (with variant <i>ulukaq</i>) and <i>kegginalek</i>. The word <i>uluaq</i> is used almost everywhere in Yup’ik, while the word <i>kegginalek</i> is found only in Hooper Bay.

The author speculates that <i>kavluun</i> may be a loan “used for primer caps which came in packs of 100”, and <i>negavaq</i> sounds like it is from <i>negaq</i> ‘snare, mesh of net’, and could be related to some net measurement.

For the Yup’ik item—<i>Pike (fish)</i>—Jacobson notes that <i>luqruuyak</i> is a rare loan word from Athabaskan (PORCUPINE is another), and what's surprising is that the upper Kuskokwim (that divides the Yup’ik <i>luqruuyak</i> area and Athabaskan territory) uses <i>qalru</i> which is not a loan word. Both<i>Keggsuli</i>  literally ‘good biter’ and <i>ciulek</i> ‘one with a front’ are “appropriate descriptive terms” for this fish. <i>Cuukvak</i> (predictable variant <i>cukvak</i> with “vowel compression”, see also KNEE) also occurs in <i>luqruuyak</i> area in the form of <i>cuukvaguaq</i> ‘alder tree’, literally ‘pretend, or one like, a <i>cuukvak</i>’. Its etymology could be from the bark of an alder that resemble pike skin on coloration.

Norton Sound Unaliq uses neither base, rather past (for intransitive and transitive) is expressed throughout context. <i>–llru-</i>, used for past transitive, is an innovation because it contains the postbase <i>~:(ng)u-</i> ‘to be’ that usually takes intransitive endings. He suggests that the use of <i>–lqe-</i> instead of <i>–llru-</i> for transitive in Upper Kuskokwim may be the “evidence for E.W. Nelson version of the Aglurmiu hypothesis”.

Scammon Bay and its neighboring Hooper Bay- Chevak have compression in common in other respects (see MY HOUSE & ITS WATER etc.). he also suggests that the compression in the upper Kuskowkim  may be a convergent development and may support the E.W.

Note for reading these maps: The original LSI maps do not indicate boundaries or areas for all languages/dialects.

361968,Yup'ik Dialect Atlas and Study: LET'S LEAVE,,,,"This map comes from a series of individual maps of Yup'ik dialect differences. The distribution maps have been created from survey results completed by bilingual teachers in 61 out of 68 Yup’ik villages. While the respective points may be the same in size, this does not reflect the population density: some villages can have less than fifty speakers while others have populations up to a thousand. 
Please note: The letters correspond to the map's original image. Thus, in this map, A stands for <i>ayiilta</i>, B stands for <i>asiilta</i>, and C stands for <i>ayalta</i>.  
For the Yup’ik item—<i>Let's leave</i>—Jacobson discusses the suffixation pattern of the ending 'let’s –': one pattern is <i>(e)lta</i>, as in <i>ayiilta</i> ‘let’s leave’, <i>itrelta</i> ‘let’s enter’, etc., and the other pattern is <i>-lta</i>, giving <i>ayalta</i> and <i>itelta</i> for the same items. the author notes that the first one is a northern pattern and the second southern pattern. The first pattern is used by older speakers and the second younger speakers reported by the four villages in the Bethel area. The author suggests that the area is shifting from the northern to the southern pattern.

Please note that rivers and villages are part of this map, but have been turned off in the default view to avoid clutter; if you would like to view them, click the appropriate boxes in the legend.
<p>
Several important features of this map require some explanation:
- The apportionment of land to different dialects is not especially meaningful; the purpose of the map is to show which villages are in which areas. For instance, the Norton Sound Kotlik subdialect consists only of the village of Kotlik; the two-dimensional area it encompasses is presumably for graphical convenience.
- The ""transitional zones"" indicate regions in which speakers cannot be definitively classified into either of the adjacent dialects.
- The ""special areas"" are not dialects, but they are linguistically significant groupings, in which ""a number of lexical (and to a lesser extent, phonological) features cut across dialect and subdialect boundaries.""
- On the original map, Jacobson divides the Kuskokwim and Yukon rivers into lower, middle, and upper regions, with approximate boundaries. These do not represent linguistically differentiated areas, but are useful for making geographic reference to certain places throughout the Atlas. These boundaries have been left off this map for the sake of space, but you may view them by clicking the original image link.
<p>
Finally, Jacobson also points out that his dialect areas correspond very little to maps of Yup'ik ""tribes"" produced by other scholars (and generally calls into question the validity of the concept of ""tribes"" with respect to the Yup'ik).",August 2012,jacobson1998,Yupik/Central_Alaskan_Yup'ik_Dialects(002).jpg,,,,,,,,

362902,Yup'ik Dialect Atlas and Study: WHEN HE SAW ME,,,,"This map comes from a series of individual maps of Yup'ik dialect differences. The distribution maps have been created from survey results completed by bilingual teachers in 61 out of 68 Yup’ik villages. While the respective points may be the same in size, this does not reflect the population density: some villages can have less than fifty speakers while others have populations up to a thousand. 
Please note: The letters correspond to the map's original image. Thus, in this map, A stands for <i>1st contemporative mood not used</i>, B stands for <i>tangellrania</i>, and C stands for <i>tangellranga</i>.  
For the Yup’ik item—<i>When he saw me</i>—Jacobson notes that <i>1st contemporative mood</i> ‘when one –ed’ is an Yup'ik innovation and only found in Yup’ik. Derived from the localis due to its localis ending <i>ni</i> on intransitive forms such as <i>qavallem<u>ni</u></i> ‘when I slept’ (compare <i>quavarpailegma</i> ‘before I slept’), <i>ni</i> is also found between the subject and object markers of transitive forms with a 4th person subject such as <i>tangllermi<u>ni</u>a</i> ‘when he (subject) saw me’. As the map indicates, <i>ni</i> in transitive forms with a 3rd or 2nd person singular subject is used primarily in the central coastal region. Areas using <i>tangellra<u>ni</u>a</i> instead of <i>tangellranga</i> also says <i>tangllerpe<u>ni</u>u</i> instead of <i>tangllerpegu</i> as elsewhere for ‘when you saw him’. Finally, the author points out that the same remnant of localis is used with the 2nd contemporative mood (‘while one –s’). Therefore, <i>tangva(gng)inanra<u>ni</u>q</i> and <i>tangva(gng)inanerpe<u>ni</u>u</i> are used instead of <i>tangva(gng)inanranga</i> and <i>tangva(gng)inanerpegu</i> for ‘while he was watching me’ and ‘while you were watching him’.

Of other Yup’ik words, <i>akakiik</i> may be from <i>akag-</i> ‘to roll’, <i>naptaq</i> literally means ‘one that is caught, as in a net’, and <i>qanerkicaq</i> is from ‘mouth’.

The localism <i>pugyaraq</i>, from <i>puge-</i> ‘to surface’, refers to the way one’s head surfaces through a parka ruff.

The author suggests that Aleut loan words in Yup’ik pre-dates Russian times and could be due to “hunting/fishing based word taboo” since these loan words are often animal names such as <i>cagiq/sagiq</i> ‘flounder’, <i>qakiiyaq</i> ‘silver salmon’, and etc.

However, only the usage of <i>Kiunga</i> is found in the following areas: most of the greater Bristol Bay area, the upper Kuskokwim and upriver Yukon, and most parts of the divergent dialects.

In addition to <i>nakleng</i>, <i>akleng</i> is also used around the mouth of the Kuskokwim area with the meaning ‘so sorry’ rather than ‘poor thing.’ The author points out that two forms started as phonological variants has obtained a semantic difference.

355998,Senufo Languages (Public Content),Senufo Language Area,,,"The Senufo or Senufic languages (Senoufo in Francophone usage) comprise ca. 15 languages spoken by the Senufo in the north of Ivory Coast, the south of Mali and the southwest of Burkina Faso. An isolated language, Nafaanra, is also spoken in the west of Ghana. The Senufo languages are generally considered a branch of the Gur sub-family of Niger–Congo languages. Garber (1987) estimates the total number of Senufos at some 1.5 million; the Ethnologue, based on various population estimates, counts 2.7 million. The Senufo languages are bounded to the west by Mande languages, to the south by Kwa languages, and to the north and east by Central Gur languages.",,"[Wikimedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Senufo_languages.png)",SenufoLanguages/SenufoLanguages.jpg,"The maps with different individual Senufo languages highlighted may be found at their respective webpages:

Regarding the question of <i>y</i> vs. <i>s</i>, surprisingly Nelson Is uses <i>ivsuk</i> instead of <i>ivyuk</i> which is very unusual for this area. So the author speculates that <i>ivsuk</i> is “a back formation from the verb <i>ivsir-</i> ‘to rain’ where the <i>i</i> would govern the choice of <i>y</i> or <i>s</i>”.  He also points out that cognates of <i>ivyuk/ivsuk</i> is unusual in other Eskimo languages too. One can see WEATHER to address the question of initial <i>c</i> in <i>cellalluk/ellalluk</i>.

According to the author, <i>e</i> is deleted in peripheral GCY; “the preceding vowel gets the stress that <i>e</i> would have had, and rhythmic stress assignment proceeds from there”. Also, <i>e</i> is deleted in core GCY, “and the word is re-evaluated for rhythmic stress just as if the <i>e</i> had never been there” which is the most extreme pattern according to Jacobson.
