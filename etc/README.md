# Configuration directory

This directory contains "configuration" data, i.e. data which helps with and
guides the conversion of the raw data to CLDF.

- [`contributions.csv`](contributions.csv) lists maps from the LL-Map legacy which
  - were not marked as deleted,
  - have metadata,
  - enhanced with structured information extracted from the HTML in the `credits` column of the database.
