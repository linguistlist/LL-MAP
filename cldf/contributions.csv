323315,Africa Before the Agricultural Age (Ehret),"Outlined on this map are the locations that Ehret hypothesizes gave rise to the Afrasan, Middle Nile, Khoisan and Niger-Congo traditions.  In his book, he describes how each area affected the development of these ancient cultures as well as some of their differences, citing examples such as the Afrasan reliance on wild grass collection for food, and Middle Nile tendency to hunt large game and fish.",,,,174e9487335f46667844aa6a370ea63f 3af9a72ef952c661f53e7c26275c18d9 6f97a4c507dfcf34bd551d8fbf922d84 aa7907f5d866d9b0a11a696f9b7178f7 cf7cad60f0f2966b637c7f342e077578
322302,African Agriculture ca. 3500 BCE (Ehret),"This illustrates Ehret's hypothesis regarding the state of agricultural development in Africa circa 3500 B.C.E.  The main changes that Ehret points out occur within two particular groups, although all were expanding.  As the Cushitic peoples spread west, they began absorbing many former Omotic groups into their societies.  Further across the continent, the West African planting agricultural tradition continued spreading to the belt of western rainforest near the Atlantic coast.",,,,322443183b9c7a6e94a7eab707705d02 3909d279efe8a2477c24d9763a97e289 3c60b3790ba10901e3450c4d80f6bf2a 4c37c89403ea22c1b8d72025cc2e2474 61866ad21063ed8318ade63d7a87e0d9 716f4194659080660c2b0f48cb3eede9 756f2eeb463c1ac94dfc46144176e83a 7ca5b69ce395c903d878bd63844a8029 8dcae11133eb759a2370a7039bc4555c bfce0cac0e4302a26b3df10d143c8645 df31961baf80ef185ac6b18130c729a9 ec68e88de8e6e16ab65c74d2d4f6ccea
323798,African Agriculture ca. 5500 BCE (Ehret),"This map displays the state and distribution of agricultural practices in Africa circa 5500 BCE.

110059,A Historical Linguistic Hypothesis for Austronesian Expansion,"This map broadly outlines a series of migration paths as described by Bellwood (2006).  He states that the hypothesis best supported by current linguistic and archaeological research is that the proto-Austronesians migrated out of mainland China around 4000 BC and across the Taiwan Strait into Taiwan.  From there, they migrated south through the Philippines, resulting in the formation of the Malayo-Polynesian subgroup.  Over time, they continued to migrate further east and west, and advancements in maritime technology allowed the Austronesians to spread out across the Pacific and Indian oceans, reaching such far-flung locations as Rapa Nui (Easter Island) in the Pacific and Madagascar in the Indian (Bellwood 2006).  This hypothesis is challenged by emerging genetics research, such as Li et al. (2008).",,,cemp,190f1d32c343329cb96b977e555731e5

354024,Australia Prehistory,"The languages of Australia are extremely diverse and 
        their origins are relatively obscure. No relationship
        has yet been determined between the languages of
        Australia and those of any other region, excluding a
        number of possible loanwords from Papuan
        languages in northern Australia.
        Relationships between Australian languages
        show that even within the same continent there is
        extreme diversity. This map shows 31 distinct 
        language families in Australia, as well as groups and
        subgroups within those families, where applicable.
        The majority of these language families are located
        in the far northern part of the Northern Territory,
        and do not seem to bear definitive similarities to one
        another, forming a linguistically dense and diverse
        region. The majority of Australia, however, is taken
        up by the large Pama-Nyungan family, which is itself
        diverse, and consists of many subgroups, including
        the large Southwest Group in Western Australia, 
        Southern Australia, and parts of the Northern
        Territory and the Paman Group in north Queensland.",,,,d39962604b18003e56881c5f38e9f9ce

In 1878 the Habsburgs were granted permission to occupy the Ottoman provinces Bosnia/Bosna and Herzegovina/Hersek, and Austria annexed Bosnia-Herzegovina as a single province in 1908. From 1867-1908 there were also Habsburg troops in the Sanjak (District) of Novi Pazar, a territory between Montenegro and Serbia.

345543,Canada: Cultural Areas,"This map was created from shapefile data provided by the National Atlas of Canada.
Canada may be divided into six broad Aboriginal cultural areas based on major geographic regions. Tribes in the same region share a greater number of cultural affinities than tribes from different regions. However only in the Arctic do the lines of geography, language and culture coincide so closely. Nunavutâs boundary strongly reflects that of the cultural zone of the Aboriginal people of the Eastern Arctic. The Inuit are descendants of the Thule, who came from Asia and lived in the Arctic for thousands of years. Their language, Inuktitut, is spoken by most of the population.
This map illustrates the six major aboriginal cultural areas of Canada. Notice that the Nunavut boundary closely reflects that of the cultural zone of the people of the Eastern Arctic. The Inuit also live in the northern regions of the Northwest Territories, northern Quebec and Labrador. The spoken language, Inuktitut, is limited to Nordic regions, while the other native cultural areas of Canada are much more heterogeneous.
The Arctic, characterized by its cold environment and scarce resources, has produced a highly specialized culture which was centred primarily on the hunt for seals and other marine mammals in coastal regions and caribou in inland areas west of Hudson Bay. Small, widely dispersed bands of hunters have traditionally followed seasonal migration patterns in search of these prey. (National Atlas of Canada)",,,,01bada888b0bd720676e1ea2536a59d4

335224,Mexico: Huastec Route (Public Content),"This map illustrates the Huastec route from c. 2000 BC to c. 1000 BC. 
""Proto-Maya, the common ancestor of all Maya tongues, was probably spoken in west-central Guatemala, 
around the highland pine-oak forests of the Cuchumatanes mountain chain: north of the Motagua and Grijalva river valleys, 
through patches of cloud forest, and down to the edge of the tropical forest lowlands near the Ixcán and Chixoy (Negro) rivers, 
which flow into the Usumacinta River (Campbell and Kaufman, p. 191). Evidence that this region was the Maya ""heartland"" include
 its being located near the center of present-day language diversity within the Maya phylum (and therefore requiring the minimum
 number of moves to place the languages in their current locations), the fact that proto-Maya included words for flora and fauna 
 from both highland and lowland areas, and the debatable idea that it is easier for a group of people to spread from a highland 
 region to a lowland one than vice-versa (Dahlin, p. 370). (...)  Whether the proto-Huastecs split from the rest of the Maya in 
 2200 or in 1200 BCE, the separation occurred at least a millennium before the rise of classic Maya culture. (...)
 If we consider 2000 BCE as a reasonable date for the Huastec/Maya split, and the slopes of the Cuchumatanes range as a 
 reasonable location for the speakers of proto-Maya, it seems likely that the split occurred after these proto-Maya speakers 
 (or a portion of them) began to migrate north, probably along the Usumacinta River, and before the two groups resulting from 
 the split began to move in opposite directions: the proto-Huastec speakers moving northwest (and, soon thereafter, 
 the proto-Chicomuceltec west into the Chiapas highlands), and the proto-Yucatec/other Maya-speakers spreading northeast 
 (one branch of which became Chontal, presumed by many from its widespread loan words and hieroglyphic evidence to be the
 dominant language of the classic Peten Maya heartland). While we have no direct archaeological evidence to explain the split 
 itself, we can assume by linguistic evidence that contact was soon cut off between the two groups, despite there being no 
 geographical feature that would automatically isolate them from each other."" ([Wikpedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huastec_people), accessed 20-Apr-2010)",,,,4bc3ae16926773501575eba8c320f0bb

Additional remarks from the legend: 
Figures for 1964 are derived from <i>Atlas narodov Mira</i> (Moscow 1964), p.20. Figures for Peisan and Azeri include the speakers of all their dialects listed separately in the Atlas. 
Figures for 2006 are extrapolated from similar cases where the society shows comparable rates of fast urbanization, education and wealth generation with more reliable and available data than Iran.
Many more people speak Persian as their first language today than did two generations ago. Heavy migration into the cities, mass education and electronic media have all helped in linguistic assimilation of many an Iranian minority member. While, e.g., around 19% of the Iranians are ethnic Azeris, only around 13% speak Azeri as their first language. Meanwhile, the percentage of those speaking Persian as their first language, may now be not much less than the 68% claimed by the Iranian census of 2001.",,,,2f845071ce544786dd970b840d075ecd 9578f1156906b5dbd5c8db0d97c3a34a

11787,Bureau of Indian Affairs Reservations (BIARes),"## Abstract:
      This map layer shows Indian lands of the United States.  Only areas of 640 
      acres or more are included.  Federally-administered lands within a 
      reservation are included for continuity; these may or may not be 
      considered part of the reservation and are simply described with their 
      feature type and the administrating Federal agency.  This is an updated 
      version of the December 2004 map layer.
    ## Purpose:
      These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the 
      national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be 
      displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale 
      data.  No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United 
      States in the use of these data.

    ## National Atlas Process description
        Working in Arc/INFO, Indian reservations and Federal lands internal 
        to them were extracted from the National Atlas Federal Lands map 
        layer.  Isolated features under 640 acres were deleted. Attributes for 
        feature type, name, administering agency, State, and State FIPS codes 
        were retained.  Adjacent Indian reservations having the same feature 
        type, name, and administering agency were merged.  State attributes of 
        merged Indian reservations were then updated.  Names for non-Indian 
        lands were deleted.  For polygons without label points, the points were 
        created and the polygons were assigned a null value. The boundaries from ATLAS_INDLN_200412 were aligned to National Park
        boundaries from ATLAS-FEDLN_200512 as part of a National Parks update to
        ATLAS-FEDLN_200512.  The file was processed as a geodatabase before it

Important details of the period include the fate of the large Songay Empire, the expansion of the kingdom of Morocco and European colonization.  The Songay Empire suffered from internal political turmoil and degenerated into civil war in the 1580s as it collapsed.  Meanwhile, the kingdom of Morocco was growing in power, and steady trade with Europeans provided them with superior weapons, allowing them to expand further as they conquered former Songay lands.  European colonial powers vied for forts and trade agreements along the Atlantic coast, although large settlements were rare (Ehret).",,,,02bac45a7444845e76fa1d9f9856629a 62f80eb5d13dd08eb4954476950d01cb a8950431358b4f5feb4937e4f2fb9b9a bd2a451eb5a0e8540f1fdc97e9efcc16 ff8dac592fc17756f39e3fe6997fc651

For the Yup’ik item—<i>Muskrat</i>—Jacobson notes that cognates of <i>kevgaluk</i> for ‘muskrat’ occur in other Eskimo languages and are found only in the extreme north and south of Yup’ik. He argues that the occurrence of <i>kevgaluk</i> in Egegik not due to the borrowing from the neighbor Alutiiq because Alutiiq has no <i>v</i> while the Egegik form does. The author claims that <i>kevgaluk</i> is from <i>kevgaq</i> ‘messenger’ and <i>iligvak/ ilegvak</i> from <i>ilik</i> ‘helper’, which shows ""a common formative idea”. Like <i>iligvak/ ilegvak</i>, the three rest words exit only in Yup’ik: “<i>kanaqlak</i> is related to <i>kanar(te)-</i> ‘to bed the head downward as toward the water’ (one can compare this to <i>paluqtaq</i> ‘beaver’ and <i>palur(te)-</i> ‘to turn stomach down’); <i>tevyuli</i> means ‘one that is good at portaging’;  <i>kuiguartaq</i> means ‘thing of the sloughs and ox-bow lakes’”.

For the Yup’ik item—<i>Person</i>——Jacobson discusses the two variants of <i>yuk</i>: one is <i>suk</i> in some areas on the Yukon which “is the result of a universal change of initial <i>y</i> to voiceless <i>s</i>,” and therefore <i>suk, sukutaq</i> ‘moisture’ and <i>saani</i>  ‘over there’—corresponding to <i>yuk, yukutq,</i> and <i>yaani</i> in most Yup’ik; the other variant is <i>cuk</i> in Chevak and Nunivak which is because “these places have initial <i>c</i> where other places have <i>y</i> but only when followed by a single vowel”, therefore <i>cuk, cukutaq</i>, but <i>yaani</i> not <i>*caani</i>. In addition, Hooper Bay follows this initial <i>c</i> pattern except for the word <i>yuk</i>. Alutiiq follows the Chevak-Nunivak pattern with <i>s</i> instead of <i>c</i>, and not the Yukon <i>s</i> pattern, given <i>suk, sukutaq</i> but <i>yaani</i> not <i>*saani</i>.

The composition of dialects spoken here is rather complex; dialects native to Southern Anhui include Wu, Hui, and Gan while others (e.g. Xiang, Min, Hakka, and She) were bought there by waves of migration into the area in the years after 1866. Jianghuai Mandarin has also heavily influenced the dialects spoken in major towns and cities, such as Dangtu, Caishi, Wuhu, and Datong.

<i>Excerpt from Hua'er meetings: dialogic song during pilgrimage (full text can be found in 'other LLMAP resources' below):</i
Hua'er (Mandarin Chinese Huā'ér 花儿) is a Pan-Ethnic Chinese-language dialogic song form that is performed largely in spontaneous festivals on holy mountaintops and other sites in Amdo (Northern Tibet). These annual events attract 100-40,000 people from many ethnic groups--the Amdo Tibetans, Muslim and Han Chinese, Salars, and Monguors--and they cluster around the summer solstice.

	These hua'er ""meetings"" 花儿会, as they are known, are concentrated where the loess plains of western China meet the Tibetan plateau in northeastern Tibet, primarily in what is today southern Gansu province and southeastern Qinghai province, but also in Ningxia and Xinjiang.
The first day, or part of the first day, is devoted to prayers for auspicious events: young couples pray for the birth of a son, farmers pray for a lack of crop-destroying hailstorms and a good harvest. Depending on the site, prayers and offerings may be made at Buddhist or Daoist temples both large and small, situated in a choice location at the sacred site. If the sacred site is a mountain, then one or more temples are located at the foot of the mountain, along heavily-travelled paths partway up, and/or at various summits with commanding vistas.

He discusses that <i>mik(e)te-</i> is limited to the central coastal area in which the form was more widespread in the past. According to the author, <i>mik(e)te-</i> is used outside of Yup’ik, in Alutiiq, and “within Yup’ik there is a remnant of the <i>t</i> from this base even in <i>mike-</i> areas”.  Finally, he points out “the universal word <i>mikelnguq</i> ‘child’ literally ‘one that is small’"" which is ""built on <i>mik(e)te-</i> and people who use <i>mike-</i> can say <i>mikellruuq</i> for ‘it is smaller' which comes from <i>mik(e)te-</i>"".

Two opposing directions occurred: assimilation regarding voicing goes leftward to give <i>tangerpegnaku</i> in the central coast region; elsewhere devoicing goes rightward to give <i>tangerpeknaku</i> with voiceless <i>n</i>.

The author argues that this localism is not an old one because of the modern instrumental postbase <i>-cuun/-ssuun</i> that appears to have replaced <i>–(u)n</i> and is now non-productive. He notes that words for ‘pencil’ use both postbase and words for pre-contact device use only the older postbase. Finally, <i>unugcuun</i> means ‘night lamp’, is another device for the night outside Nelson Is.

He discusses that the deletion of the initial <i>k</i> (except in some divergent dialects) from <i>kegturyaq</i> to give <i>egturyaq</i> is like the pattern in original <i>kenlluni</i> WATER GOING DOWN becomes <i>enlluni</i> in GCY. Finally, the author points out that there are no cognates of the peripheral GCY word <i>makuryaq/ makursaq</i> (the variation is predictable) from other Eskimo even though “the etymology is not shallow (as in the case of <i>panayuli</i>, literally ‘good spearer’ for BUMBLEBEE)"".

One can see this through MUSKRAT. While <i>avcellngaq</i> and <i>avelngaq</i> are unpredictable variants, the other three can be predicted in the places where they are used.

Settling on the banks of the Yellow River in what is today Qinghai province, they intermarried with Tibetans and later Muslim Chinese, incorporating many elements of these groups into their culture and language. Today, the Salars number over 90,000, but their unwritten language is rapidly giving way to the dominant languages, particularly to Chinese (Dwyer 2000).
The Salars are one of ethnic groups (along with Amdo Tibetans, Muslim Han Chinese, and Monguors) that participate in Hua'er(Mandarin Chinese Huā'ér 花儿), a Pan-Ethnic Chinese-language dialogic song form that is performed largely in spontaneous festivals on holy mountaintops and other sites in Amdo (Northern Tibet).

11648,Reflexes of Proto-Athabaskan Features in Modern Athabaskan Languages (Gary Holton),"This work represents the culmination of decades worth of fieldwork by various individuals as well as Dr. Holton's personal fieldwork. The tree-model of language relationships in Athabaskan linguistics can run into difficulties, and so this map shows the ways that the features of Proto-Athabaskan are realized in the various Athabaskan languages.
What follows is an explanation of the data we have up for display:
<p>
<b>Reflexes of proto-Athabaskan stem-intial obstruent series.</b>
<dl>
<dt>A <b>series</b> refers to a set of unaspirated, aspirated, and ejective stops/affricates at the same place of articulation. This set changes as unit historically. Thus, e.g., the series *ts refers to *ts, *tsh, and *ts'</dt>
<dd>*ts --> ts	tth	tl	kw	t?	f	p</dd>
<dd>*ch --> ts	ch	s</dd>				
<dd>*chw --> ts	ch	tr	pf	s</dd>		
<dd>*k --> k	ch	ch-k	tsy	sh</dd>		
<dd>*q  --> q	k</dd>					
<dt><b>Tone</b> refers to whether the language has tone developed from Proto-Athabaskan (PA) constricted syllables</dt>
<dd>tone =  absent, vestigial, present, complex</dd>
<dt><b>Tone Value</b> refers to the pitch which is realized from PA constricted syllables</dt>
<dd>tone value =none, low, high</dd>
<dt><b>-C' zone</b> refers to the degree of reduction of PA stem-final glottalized consonants</dt>
<dd>Zones are marked as 0-4 from least to most reduced</dd>
<dt><b>-CC</b> refers to the preservation of original suffixes in coda clusters</dt>
<dd>-CC is either yes or no, with yes meaning that (some) suffixes are preserved</dd>

12644,Changes in Even Territories and Language Areas,"Though the Yukagirs occupied much of the northern Siberia around 1650, a reduction in their area and numbers took place largely because of Chukchi expansion in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In addition, many Yukagirs died from introduced diseases such as smallpox in the eighteenth century. According to Stephen A. Wurm, the Yukagirs had developed writing system composed of symbolic signs until the 19th century. The Yukagirs numbered about 5,000 at the middle of the seventeenth century and dropped to 400 in 19th century.",,,eve ykg yux,54eafa49a1217bb0540e953a66fdb153

11641,World: Pacific Language Mapping (ECAI),"The Austronesian Team has released the ©ECAI Digital Language Atlas of the Pacific. The atlas includes the Pacific area, Southeast Asia (apart from Burma), and Madagascar.	Across the Pacific and Indian oceans, the Austronesian speaking people have voyaged for centuries making a network of communication within a linguistic family that became the most extensive in the world prior to European arrival. The cultures were launched from the Western Pacific and the early Austronesian speakers reached islands of further distance apart traveling in lashed and pegged canoes across vast expanses of ocean. The Electronic Cultural Atlas Initiative (ECAI) over the past few years has developed as a group interested in the academic research and international collaboration. The Austronesian projects were proposed by the founder and chairman of ECAI, Lewis Lancaster, at a meeting entitled Austronesian Studies in Taiwan--Retrospective and Prospect (UC Berkeley sponsored with the Shung Ye Museum in 1997). Since then collaborative teams have taken up the idea by researching the possibilities of cultural mapping using a geographic information system (GIS) to integrate the heritage of a place.This project is a model for future language mapping because it combines the generation of a digital version of older printed language maps with the collection of data on contemporary languages areas, and then the use of dynamic (time-enabled) map display techniques capable of showing visually the changes in language boundaries. The work will also give us an opportunity to advance our work on the design and use of gazetteers of language areas. A conventional gazetteer of Austronesian place-names would be supplemented (or complemented) by a directory of languages and dialects with the formal geographical specifications of where they are (or were) spoken at different times. These data would be coupled with map displays such that any combination of data from the gazetteer could be displayed at will. There are plans for a peer-reviewed digital publication in collaboration with the California Digital Library administered by the Office of the President of the University of California.",,,,

The distribution maps have been created from survey results completed by bilingual teachers in 61 out of 68 Yup’ik villages. While the respective points may be the same in size, this does not reflect the population density: some villages can have less than fifty speakers while others have populations up to a thousand. 
Please note: The letters correspond to the map's original image. Thus, in this map, A stands for <i>kenlluni</i> while B stands for <i>enlluni</i>.
For the Yup’ik item—<i>Water going down</i>—According to the comparative considerations Jacobson notes that the original form of the verb base in Yup’ik was <i>kente-</i> in three out of four divergent dialects. The <i>k</i> has been deleted to give <i>ente-</i> in most Yup’ik, and similar bases are <i>kenir-/ enir</i> ‘to point’, <i>kenuur-/ enuur-</i> ‘to push a little’, and <i>kenegte-/ (e)negte-</i> ‘to press down on’. One can compare this to the initial <i>n</i> in certain areas for BONE and LAUGHING and also see Jacobson 1984a  p.34 for these initial <i>k</i>’s and <i>n</i>’s.

For the Yup’ik item—<i>Tea & sugar</i>—Jacobson notes the map describing the <i>s</i> or <i>ch</i> sounds borrowed from Russian. ‘Tea’ is <i>chay</i> and ‘sugar’ <i>sа́khar</i> in Russian. Both Russian sounds become <i>s</i> in Yup’ik in places where one uses <i>saayuq</i> and <i>saarralaq</i>; both become <i>c</i> in Yup’ik in other areas where one says <i>caayuq</i> and <i>caarralaq</i>. The Russian original is followed in certain areas where one says <i>caayuq</i> and <i>saarralaq</i> because they have great Russian influence around Russian Mission on the Yukon, the upper Kuskokwim and the Nushagak River and Lake Iliamna areas. The author suggests that no area would go against the original Russian to use <i>saayuq</i> but <i>caarralaq</i>.

The author suggests that <i>alungun</i> is such a natural word that its cognates are used in the Diomedes and in East Greenland (an independent development). In peripheral GCY and non-GCY Yup’ik where <i>ulu(q)</i> is ‘tongue’, and <i>alungun</i> refers to ‘dog-feeding trough’ which is also a device for lapping.

Newman also talks about how expansions affected multiple groups positively. For example, Ubangians learned about grain cultivation from Central Sudanic farmers along their northern boundary, enabling them to colonize both moist and dry woodland habitats.

This classification provides a framework for understanding the movements and settlement patterns of the diverse Native American Tribes throughout the Formative Period. These cultural areas are not exact, as they were no fixed boundaries between regions. Often there were considerable cultural similarities among different arreas, or significant differences between tribes in the same area. Anthropologists have devised various schemes for determining cultural areas. The ten culture areas represent the most commonly used system (Flanders, 1998:13).",,,,31ed398e03bae6b5186007b08a167396

The distributions maps have been created from survey results completed by bilingual teachers in 61 out of 68 Yup’ik villages. While the respective points may be the same in size, this does not reflect the population density: some villages can have less than fifty speakers while others have populations up to a thousand. 
Please note: The letters correspond to the map's original image. Thus, in this map, A stands for <i>ayagnginanemni</i> while B stands for <i>ayainanemni</i>. 
For the Yup’ik item—<i>While I was going</i>—Jacobson discusses the suffixation pattern that used with the 2nd contemporative mood. The marker is <i>+nginaner-</i> in the pattern of ayagnginanemni, while the marker is <i>(ng)inaner-</i> in the pattern of <i>ayainanemni</i>. The author suggests that people follow the first pattern would also say <i>kaiginanemni</i> for ‘while I was hungry’ and <i>qanrinanemni </i> for ‘while I was speaking’, while those who follow the second pattern would use <i>kaignginanemni</i> and <i>qanernginanemni</i> for the same. The distribution follows the common theme of  core GCY vs. peripheral GCY plus divergent dialects. BECAUSE I LEFT has the same distribution.

11724,The Kalenjin from 1400-1500 AD (Ehret),"The division of the proto-Kalenjin community began early in the second millenium, and this separation resulted in the large dialectal variation seen among Kalenjin languages today (Ehret).  Illustrated on this map are the areas which several specific proto-groups inhabited around 1400-1500.  Ehret reconstructs this past by using information gained from the study of their modern descendants, including both cultural and linguistic details.  An example of this investigation is his research into musical instruments; he points out that the drum, although rare among Southern Nilotic peoples, does not have a term in proto-Kalenjin that is known, and this indicates the possibility that drums were introduced to a descendant group.",,,aam bntd bxk kale luyi mas muu myx-lug soz tcc tetu,af050b2fc024608b386d7cd32eeb7688
11725,The Proto-Kalenjin and Their Neighbors ca. 1000 AD (Ehret),"This map illustrates the approximate locations of the proto-Kalenjin people and their neighbors.  These descendants of the Southern Nilotes were closely related to the Kitoki (known also as Bukusu or Yumbu), and shared many cultural as well as linguistic aspects.  The proto-Kalenjin (and now, modern Kalenjin) economy was centered around grain cultivation and the raising of livestock, and their societal structure has remained relatively unchanged over the centuries (Ehret).",,,bntd bxk kale mas masb muu scus snil soz tcc,e087c04a8fa33a5b6f3b573eb3de2e33
11726,"The Proto-Southern Nilotes and Their Neighbors, ca. 100-400 A.D. (Ehret)",This map illustrates the culture areas of the Proto-Southern Nilotes and their neighbors. Ehret argues that there is linguistic evidence to support the location of these communities. Since all attested Southern Nilotic languages of more northerly areas in later times show the defining sound change of proto-Southern Nilotic -- the loss of [r] before [i] in word-final syllables -- it is probable that the dialect or dialects of ancestral to proto-Southern Nilotic were spoken by people living North of the belt between Kilimanjaro and Lake Victoria. Ehret claims that the numerous Southern Nilotic loanwords sugggest the Victoria pre-Southern Nilotic population lived in the areas east and southeast from Lake Victoria. Several loanswords from pre-Southern Nilotic can also be distinguished in Bantu languages.,,,,39c805648f36009e69c75b06e8252dbd fa9310189ddc5795f8f45770a32917d2

Please note: The letters correspond to the map's original image. Thus, in this map, A stands for <i>massiinaq</i>, B stands for <i>elliqeryaraq</i>, C stands for <i>levaaq</i>, and D stands for <i>kaassalinaq</i>
For the Yup’ik item—<i>Outboard motor</i>—Jacobson notes that <i>levaaq</i> refers to the noise of a motor, and <i>elliqeryaraq</i> means ‘a way to just put it’ and refers to the ease of putting an outboard motor on a boat. <i>Elliqeryaraq</i> is a recently coined word yet widespread except in the geographical center of Yup’ik along the Kuskokwim where the most villages use two or three of other words. According to the author, <i>kaassalinaq</i> is from English and <i>massiinaq</i> may be from Russian and reinforced by English later on and is also used for ‘sewing machine’.

Bantu advancement, as shown on this map, disrupted the groups that had already settled in these areas and continued until the seventeenth century. The displacement of the previous inhabitants was not complete, however; two Khoisan groups (the Hadza and the Sandawe) along with some Southern Cushites remained in Tanzania (Newman).",,,bez bntd chag ebu fip gog heh hts kale kam kik kiv kki kln ksb lag lai meru mhd nih nym nyy sad sbk sbp suk tvs,9dd967216a76fad462d3ac120220d7bb

This map shows the earliest migrations through the area.  They began with the Southern Cushites approximately 5,000 years ago; around 1000 BC, the Eastern Cushites made their way south.

Newman, the interior of East Africa is one of the most complex ethnolinguistic regions on the continent, due to the continuous movement of groups, including Khoisan, Cushitic, Nilotic and Bantu peoples.  As he states in his book, the most influential migrations were those of the Eastern Nilotes.  Despite the characterization of their encounters with other cultures as hostile and often violent, it was more common for groups to be gradually displaced or absorbed, with some maintaining independence and coexisting.  Such was the case with the Southern Cushites, who were displaced over time, and the Kalenjins, who were assimilated into Bantu society (Newman).",,,bfa chag ecus enil gog kam kdj kdj-dod kdj-jie kik lot mas mas-aru orom pko rel saq teo toq tuv,a662327ebc87f32243e1669fafdf2777
11734,"Ngoni, Kamba, Arab-Swahili, and Yao Disruptions and Movement Within the Interior Mosiac (Newman)","According to James L. Newman, the interior of East Africa is one of the most complex ethnolinguistic regions on the continent, due to the continuous movement of groups, including Khoisan, Cushitic, Nilotic and Bantu peoples.  During the nineteenth century, two major events brought change once again to east Africa: the arrival of the Ngoni and the growth of the trade industries from the coast.  The Ngoni fought their way north, and many peoples fled, were destroyed or were assimilated; some stood their ground, however, and the constant turmoil that resulted prevented population increases for the rest of the century.  By contrast, the steadily improving trade markets encouraged expansion.  Arab-Swahili, Kamba and Yao traders connected the interior of the continent with the coast (Newman 1995: 175).  However, during this era, no states as prosperous or powerful as those in the interlacustrine region would arise (Newman).",,,bez dne gog heh kam mas ngo nxi nym prar snq swah yaoo,afe4891dca18a25f2904a86c0db5ebac

11736,Advancement of Food-Producing Economies Accompanying Khoikhoi and Bantu Migrations (Newman),"This map highlights the geographic features and peoples that influenced the development of southern Africa.  The Khoikhoi herders and Bantu cultivators migrated along the route shown, forcing the San to shift a little farther north.  Despite this displacement, these groups coexisted for some time, until the arrival of European settlers pressured them to move north again.  With this reversal of directions, the Europeans created a wave of migration; the resulting clashes between the Europeans and the Bantu and multiple Bantu groups affected populations as far north as Tanzania (Newman 1995: 184-186).",,,bntd khoe kwz naq naq-dam,3ac4a62dede8627b702192fecf81b372

In the Northern region of Africa, skeletal remains demonstrate that Cro-Magnon precursors to modern Mediterranean causaoids inhabited the area from the Lower Nile into the Maghrib. Although skeletons of tall negroids are few, those that exist exihibit characteristics of the sedentarizing lakeside and riverside peoples of the Sahara, the Sahel, the Middle Nile and Eastern Africa.

This is not to suggest that Islam spread at a similar pace, however.  It was not until the Fatamid dynasty that considerable pressure and threat of economic loss was used to encourage conversion (Newman 1995: 77-80).",,,bej berb tash tuq,775093765495131cb2c1d2b5e949cf54

The term Metis is used for several of the languages spoken by the Metis ethnic group, who number about 100,000 and live mostly in the prairies in the Canadian provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and the Northwest Territories; North Dakota, and Montana in the United States. Since many Metis were nomads, they can also be found as far south as the Grand Ronde Reservation in Oregon. In spite of their lack of a common language, the Metis do indeed form an ethnic group. Part of their shared history is the fact that they centered in the early 1800s around the Red River Settlement which is close to present day Winnipeg (Bakker and Papen, 1996).",,,,0d8cff750e22ee0aa495f956572ee0a1 cf6ecde9139d34dcf68de7444da6e906 f9ee306a1d87e0a88de668fda32f8016
110011,"Philippines: Philippine Settlement, Migrations and Contact","This map reflects two contrasting scholarly hypotheses regarding migration paths and the settlement of the Philippines.  The first hypothesis states that Austronesian migrants traveled south from Taiwan through the archipelago before continuing further south through Oceania, west to Madagascar and east toward Polynesia, Rapa Nui and Hawaii.  The second, offered as an alternative by Delfin et al. (2010), states that while some groups from Taiwan clearly moved south to populate areas of the Philippines, most of the genetic affiliations observed for those living in the southern islands of the chain are shared between the majority of East Asians.  This suggests that additional populations moving from East Asia are quite likely, although further analysis on more genes would be necessary to fully support the conclusion (this study focused exclusively on the Y-chromosome).  
Focusing upon the Negrito populations of the Philippines in order to determine their origins, Delfin et al. (2010) provides strong evidence that Negrito and non-Negrito groups in the Philippines share ancestry and were likely part of the same migration, rather than Negrito populations being descendants of aboriginal peoples present at the time of Austronesian settlement.  They also observed in their study that some of the Negrito groups studied appear to share lineage with several Australian aboriginal groups, and these connections are noted on the map.",,,,eb1e7fc7584a7d0159d36aa4c51a710b

(2008) based on genetic analysis of Y chromosome data gathered from 64 populations (30 Daic, 23 Island Southeast Asian and 11 Taiwan aboriginal).   Their study found that both the Taiwan and Island Southeast Asian populations were more closely related to Daic than to one another, indicating that Daic is likely the ancestral group from which the others derived separate paternal lineages.  This conclusion casts doubt upon the hypothesis put forth by many historical linguists that Austronesian populations arrived at their current locations by migrating south through Taiwan; none of the haplogroup data analysed suggests that these two populations are related more closely to one another than they are to Daic, despite the linguistic similarity observed amongst speakers.  This proposal is inconsistent with current historical linguistic hypotheses, such as those shown on the maps below.",,,anes,3df421db7a9d1e3386a03be31600708b b70c5abb2e21d1a68e67dc14d962116d
109891,Southeast Asia: Proposed Migrations based on Genetic Analysis (HUGO Pan-Asian SNP Consortium),"This map shows probable migration routes for several east Asian population groups as determined by genetic analysis.  In addition to determining that genetic ancestry and linguistic affiliations were closely correlated, the HUGO Pan-Asian Consortium discovered that, ""more than 90% of East Asian haplotypes could be found in either Southeast Asian or Central-South Asian populations [...] with haplotype diversity decreasing from south to north,"" (The HUGO Pan-Asian SNP Consortium 2009).  This suggests that southeastern Asia has a higher degree of genetic diversity than the northeast.  This in turn provides evidence toward the conclusion that modern East Asian populations are at least in part descended from groups that lived in this southern area.     Furthermore, these results suggest that the two-wave hypothesis for the settlement of southeast Asia and the Pacific is not accurate.  Although they state that further studies should be undertaken for verification, their current findings point toward a shared ancestry and a migration history that, ""unites the
Negrito and non-Negrito populations of Southeast
and East Asia via a single primary wave of entry
of humans into the continent,"" (The HUGO Pan-Asian SNP Consortium 2009: 1545).",,,,2c2c6a67d7c97eac9c4b604e94d7c9fc 53f35399e3f7cbc17ff712ae7fb4d624

11835,Australia: Language Locations and Tribal Groups (Dixon and Blake),"This is a compilation of six different maps showing various language locations and tribal groups in the Australia region.
		The Wargamay map displays the Wargamay language and its dialects as well as the neighboring languages. 
		According to Dixon, Wargamay, Hinchinbrook Biyay, and Halifax Biyay are all dialects of the Wargamay language. 
		He also explains that there are strong similarities between Wargamay and the bordering languages of Giramay and Nyawaygi,
		but these similarities do not suggest a ""close genetic connection"" (Dixon).
		The dialectal boundary between Biyay and Halifax Biyay are based loosely on information provided by the source. 
		The Watjarri map illustrates the Watjarri language, ""spoken by the descendants of an Aboriginal tribe previously 
		camped along a section of the Murchison River,"" and its respective neighboring languages and place names (Douglas). 
		Around these stations and towns, within the original Watjarri area, were formed dialects. Furthermore, the railway 
		allowed for influences from other surrounding languages which Douglas describes is evident in the borrowings across 
		vocabularies. The Tasmania map shows a speculative inference of the different locations of the languages and dialects 
		of Tasmania which are now extinct. 
		On the map are 15 regions to which vocabulary are assigned and cross-compared to 
		analyze the genetic relationship between the languages. Crowley and Dixon suggest that there were at least eight languages 
		within Tasmania; however, this conclusion is ""tentative"" as little data is available on many of the languages. The 
		Margany/Gunya map displays Margany and Gunya, ""the south-westernmost of the long chain of closely related dialects known 
		to (...) linguists as the Mari languages"" and other surrounding languages and place names (Breen). The Anguthimiri map 
		highlights the area of Anguthimri speaking groups as well as neighboring peoples and languages. According to Crowley, 
		Anguthimri has ""one of the most unusual phonological systems"" consisting of single-syllable words, consonant clustered
		initial syllables, and an extensive vowel system (Crowley).",,,0gw 0sc aly are bcj bdy bdy-gid bym dbl dbl-gir dhr dhu dji duj duj-dja gbb gbc gbd gcd gup gyy ibd jig kgl kgs kjn kky kld-yuw ktd ktg kux lnj mpb mph nbx-bid nbx-kal nbx-yar ngk nid nlr nna nyt pit piu pjt qe3 qwdl rit tasm tbh tiw urf vml wbj wbv wim wmt wnd wrg wrm wyb-ngi xtz yia yii zmc zmr zmu,249e411520eaf43577a785f6ba4bcbff 62ca4e329ec70a7ec600763c5e6d1c5c 96d5b322a602abb798b5fb7246d2df5f a91f8bb5aa612dd25caea604b003adf2 dba933d97c57a149990088464e1fd56c ec9c494b7fa8ad0d6333e0fdca4db6e8

342400,Language Atlas of China: Manchu-Tungus Languages,"Manchu-Tungus languages are spoken in China, Mongolia, and the former USSR; this map depicts the locations of those spoken in China. Use of these languages is declining - as of 1982, there were around 4.4 million ethnic Manchu-Tungus in China, only 46,000 of whom spoke Manchu-Tungus languages. Most of these speakers are bilingual in Chinese and their ethnic language; some also speak another neighboring minority language.

Regarding classification, the authors note that ""some scholars outside China regard Xibo as a Manchu dialect, Oroqen as Evenki under a different name, and Hezhe as one of the sub-dialects ... of the Nanai language"". They also note that the terms ""Ewenki"" and ""Evenki"" are not synonymous; the former refers to an ethnic group living in China, the latter to one living in the former USSR. The languages spoken by these two groups are different.

We have digitized a number of cities and place names to provide context for these language locations, which you can view by selecting them in the legend.

The original series of maps combined information from different sources, and as a result certain groups appear under multiple names. Although the term ""ethnic groups"" is used, Wassmann notes that most terms refer to locations or language names. The group names in the 1873-1907 data set, with Butam as the sole exception, are all taken from island names (for smaller islands) or region names (for the main island).

110129,A New Hypothesis of Austronesian Expansion and Cultural Contact,"Reflected upon this map is a new hypothesis of Austronesian expansion, based upon research in linguistics, archaeology and human genetics.  The majority of current studies agree that Taiwanese peoples are related both genetically and linguistically to Austronesians now living in southeast Asia and the Pacific, and many sources agree that they probably arrived on the island from mainland China around 6000 years ago.  From this point, however, linguistic and genetic hypotheses have diverged: historical linguists and archaeologists have so far supported a model in which Austronesians migrated south through the Philippines to what is now Indonesia, spreading east and west from there.  Geneticists, however, have found that many Austronesian populations are more closely related to their mainland Asian ancestors than they are to the Taiwanese, in effect making the Taiwan aboriginal peoples and the Austronesians parallel branches from the same tree. 
Also included here are several genetic and archaeological hypotheses of cultural contact and migration, including Blench's (2010) proposal of contact with the Indian subcontinent and Delfin et al.'s (2010) genetic relations with several Australian aboriginal groups.   
Rather than viewing Austronesian expansion as a series of straightforward migrations, it seems more and more necessary to delve more deeply into the history and culture of the peoples and the area in order to better reconstruct their history.  As further research is undertaken, more of these details will come to light, allowing interdisciplinary scholars to continue improving on what seems to be a solid foundational understanding of the region and its linguistic and genetic history.",,,,27d69d5ee08948f391330a55d0f420ee

According to Cribb, the first Austronesians arrived in Taiwan around 4500 BC and from there progressed south before spreading outward (Cribb 2010).  This hypothesis differs from the one currently supported by genetic research, as shown in maps such as those listed in Other Resources below.",,,,797267f539dbf21de0adcf8577784e1d 7c040fff49652b4e038bfa3784eab6da
110103,The Express Train to Polynesia Model (Gray and Jordan),"This map is a graphical representation of the ""Express Train"" model of Austronesian migration, a popular hypothesis based on archaeological and linguistic research.  In their article, Gray and Jordan (2000) explain how they made use of a tree model, most commonly used in biology, to first create a language family tree.  Then, using statistical analysis, they analyzed the likelihood of their proposed sequence of events (in this case, the migration patterns) occurring.  Each of the circles on this map represents one of the stations compared against the language family tree.  They found that the hypothesized routes fit the language tree exceptionally well, and the statistical analysis showed that, ""that the express-train character-state tree fits the language tree with significantly fewer steps than would occur by chance,"" (Gray and Jordan 2000: 1053).

For the Yup’ik item—<i>Ice</i>—Jacobson notes that <i>qenu</i> and <i>ciku</i> are used both outside and in some areas inside Yup’ik. <i>Genu</i> is ‘fragile ice on the water (either slush ice or a thin layer)’. <i>qenu</i> appears in the derivative form <i>qenuirun</i> ‘net-like scoop for removing ice fragments from a water hole’ in the places where only <i>ciku</i> is used.

He suggests that <i>Kuman</i> occurring in Upper Kuskokwim, Nunivak, and the Egegik area supports the E.W. Nelson version of the Aglurmiut hypothesis.

For the Yup’ik item—<i>Milk</i>—Jacobson addresses the question concerning the word for ‘canned milk’, ‘milk in a carton’, etc. According to the author, a Russian loan word is used except in Norton Sound Unaliq which uses <i>amngaq</i> ‘breast milk’. <i>Malak'uuq</i>, used only in Nunivak, Nelson Is, and Stebbins, is a more common Russian pronunciation from the Russian source word <i>molokо́</i> and <i>muluk'uuq</i> has less Russian sounding. He suggests that the Russians who introduced ‘milk’ might have spoken minority dialect of Russian. Finally, he points out that in several areas there is <i>milek</i> from English and <i>milek’uuq</i> from a blend of English and Russian.

One can compare this to (IT) WILL SPILL. Also, he suggests that <i>alleqaq</i> in Norton Sound Unaliq may be “from a reinsertion of this ‘hatted’ <i>e</i> but with <i>l</i>               kept voiceless.” Finally, he points out that “<i>al’a</i> is a widespread casual or endearing form of the basic word” but may have replaced <i>alqaq</i> to a degree in the Lake Iliamna area.

While the respective points may be the same in size, this does not reflect the population density: some villages can have less than fifty speakers while others have populations up to a thousand. 
Please note: The letters correspond to the map's original image. Thus, in this map, A stands for <i>qiini</i> and B stands for <i>qagaani</i>.
For the Yup’ik item—<i>(In the extended area) out there</i>—Jacobson discusses the item that addresses the formation of adverbs from the three demonstrative pronouns <i>agna</i> ‘that across there (extended)’, <i>pagna</i> ‘that up there (extended)’, and <i>qagna</i> ‘that out there (extended)’. The standard pattern for this adverb formation is that “the final segment <i>na</i> of the pronoun is replaced with <i>ani</i> (and similarly for case other than the localis), giving first <i>*agani,*pagani</i>, and <i>*qagani</i> (compare <i>amani</i> ‘over there (obscured)’ and then by velar-dropping and vowel-raising these become <i>iini</i> ‘across there’, <i>piini</i> ‘up there’, and <i>qiini</i> ‘out there’. While Norton Sound, Nunivak and the area where the Yukon and Kuskokwim are close together and follow this standard pattern, all the rest of Yup’ik avoid such vowel-raising and insert an extra <i>a</i> instead to give <i>aga<u>a</u>ni, paga<u>a</u>ni, and qaga<u>a</u>ni</i>. The author notes that the vowel-raising (not the velar-dropping) is “objectionable,” and therefore, from the demonstrative pronoun <i>ugna</i> ‘that toward exist (restrict)’, one gets the adverb *ugani and hence <i>uani</i> ‘toward exit’.

Due to the use of cognates of <i>qerrulliik</i> in Eskimo languages to the north of Yup’ik and of <i>ulruk</i> in Alutiiq, the pattern can be north vs. south with the division line far to the south (COOKING is another example).

The distribution maps have been created from survey results completed by bilingual teachers in 61 out of 68 Yup’ik villages. While the respective points may be the same in size, this does not reflect the population density: some villages can have less than fifty speakers while others have populations up to a thousand. 
Please note: The letters correspond to the map's original image. Thus, in this map, A stands for <i>qavarcuun</i>, while B stands for <i>qavarrsuun</i>. 
For the Yup’ik item—<i>Device for sleeping</i>--Jacobson notes that the modern instrumental postbase <i>+cuun</i> or <i>+ssuun</i> is assessed. According to the author, ""Stebbins is like Tununak from where its residents came. Tununak is like Hooper Bay Chevak and Newtok."" There is no association between the choice of <i>c</i> or <i>ss </i> in postbase and the initial <i>c </i> or <i>s</i> in Russian loans

317395,Inca Empire Expansion and Its Road System,"This map shows the Inca Empire expansion and shows its road system. Though many descriptions about the Inca are mixed with legends and myths, around 1438-93, under the rulers Pachacutec and his son Tupac Yupanqui, the Inca had expanded from a small chiefdom to the empire shown in this map. The Inca Empire spread from Cuzco, in the southern highlands, down into Chile, northwest Argentina, and up through Ecuador. One aspect of the Inca Empire often noted is its brevity: the Inca state lasted for 90 years or so, and the Inca Empire for little more than 50 years before Spanish colonization. The roads are foundational to the Inca people. Additionally, the Inca's roads system were the centers for transportation and goods storage.",,,,14848bd0fdb56e2cbac10c24e86946e3 80edca4cacf673dc979b7e509fbcbefc 9ea7286110fff4c2a3a09052576aa5a7 f36fce3d40eeddbe8db65c4d1da6e92c

346160,Language Atlas of China: Minority Languages in Northern China,"This map depicts minority languages spoken in Northern China. The language areas shown subsume about 40% of China's land area, 15% of its population, and 25% of its minority language speakers. Of the languages displayed on the map, by far the most widely spoken is Uygur, with almost 6 million speakers, followed by Mongolian, with 3 million, and Korean, with 1.8 million.
<p>
The authors describe the minority languages of Northern China as ""a belt across the top of China"" divided into four sections:
1. the westernmost, consisting of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, in which Uygur and Kazak speakers are most populous;
2. the northern parts of Qinhai and Gansu, and the western part of Inner Mongolia, where speakers of Mongolian, Tibetan and Dongxiang are most populous;
3. the eastern and central part of Inner Mongolia, where speakers of Mongolian are most populous;
4. and Manchuria, in which Korean speakers are most populous.
In the latter three regions, Chinese dialects are more widely spoken than minority languages; only in Xinjiang are minority languages more common.

For the Yup’ik item—<i>I don't love him</i>—Jacobson discusses the prosody difference among the two subdialects of the Norton Sound dialect and the rest of Yup’ik. He notes that “neither the Kotlik nor Unaliq subdialects of Norton Sound retract stress from an open syllable (<i>ri</i> in <i>ken(e)kenritaqa</i>) to a preceding closed syllable, which is unlike the rest of Yup’ik. According to the author, Unaliq “retains stressed e in an open syllable (the second <i>e</i> in <i>kenékenritaqa</i>), and then closes the syllable by germinating the following consonant” which is unlike Kotlik and the rest of Yup’ik.

It is a process of deletion of a certain vowel that creates a long and unrhythmical vowel which does not cause germination. its process is similar to the case (HE) KEEPS BEING SAD.

He notes, in Hooper Bay- Chevak, in Egegik and most peripheral GCY “if deletion of a ‘hatted’ <i>e</i> causes a voiced fricative to be followed by a stop or voiceless fricative the fricative in question stays voiced (as shown by the apostrophe). In core GCY and in Nunivak if a fricative ends up being followed by a stop or voiceless fricative for that reason that the fricative in question becomes voiceless.” The author also points out that areas using <i>kuveciquq</i> would also use germinated <i>ll</i> for <i>nerelleq</i> ‘the one that ate,’ and areas using <i>kuv'ciquq</i> would say <i>ner’lleq</i>, and areas using <i>kuvciquq</i> would say <i>nerrleq</i>.

The postbase has become fused to the base in many areas so <i>qeceg-</i> alone is used in certain outlying areas. He also notes that cognates of the expanded base <i>qeckar-</i> are used both to the north and south of Yup’ik. <i>Meceg-</i> is limited to the area in contact with Inupiaq.

For the Yup’ik item—<i>""Salmon berry"", cloudberry</i>—Jacobson suggests that <i>aqavsik/ aqevyik</i> is the original Yup’ik name and has cognates in other Eskimo. He also notes that this word is limited to Norton Sound Unaliq and Hooper Bay-Chevak within Yup’ik. All the words reflect the important role of this kind of berry in Yup’ik life except for <i>epulek</i> ‘one with a handle or stem' which is the descriptive Egegik localism. Finally, he points out that <i>atsaq</i> means just ‘berry’ and <i>naunraq</i> means just ‘plant’ in the areas where these words don’t mean ‘salmonberry’. <i>Atsarpiaq</i> and <i>atsalugpiaq</i> mean ‘genuine, original berry’.

		using data from Karyn Crawford's work on Mefele (Crawford 2005).
	Mefele is spoken in the Far North Province of Cameroon, Mayo-Tsanaga
Division, Mokolo Subdivision. The dialects, which generally consist of one village each and which are named after that village,
are located near Mokolo (Crawford 2005)- the sixth-largest city in the province.

Norton Sound Unaliq uses neither base, rather past (for intransitive and transitive) is expressed throughout context. <i>–llru-</i>, used for past transitive, is an innovation because it contains the postbase <i>~:(ng)u-</i> ‘to be’ that usually takes intransitive endings. He suggests that the use of <i>–lqe-</i> instead of <i>–llru-</i> for transitive in Upper Kuskokwim may be the “evidence for E.W. Nelson version of the Aglurmiu hypothesis”. He also notes that in <i>nerellruaqa</i> for ‘I ate it’ areas one can use <i>nerelqaqa</i> with subtle difference, ‘it’s the thing I ate’.

Scammon Bay and its neighboring Hooper Bay- Chevak have compression in common in other respects (see MY HOUSE & ITS WATER etc.). he also suggests that the compression in the upper Kuskowkim  may be a convergent development and may support the E.W.

362941,Yup'ik Dialect Atlas and Study: WHO OWNS IT?,"This map comes from a series of individual maps of Yup'ik dialect differences. The distribution maps have been created from survey results completed by bilingual teachers in 61 out of 68 Yup’ik villages. While the respective points may be the same in size, this does not reflect the population density: some villages can have less than fifty speakers while others have populations up to a thousand. 
Please note: The letters correspond to the map's original image. Thus, in this map, A stands for <i>kia pikau?</i>, B stands for <i>kia pikagu?</i>, C stands for <i>kia pikaung?</i>, D stands for <i>kitum pikau?</i>.  
For the Yup’ik item—<i>Who owns it?</i>—According to Jacobson, the item addresses the distribution of the traditional relative case of <i>kina</i> ‘who’, kia, and regularized form <i>kitum</i> (compare <i>kitumek</i> ‘from whom’, <i>kitumun</i> ‘to whom’ etc). Both the regularized form (used often by the young people) and the traditional form are found on Nelsion Is, the Canineq area, and Bristol Bay. Also, he notes that <i>kiam</i>, an alternative to <i>kia</i>, could be from <i>kia-am</i> ""or a relative case marker <i>m</i> tacked onto the (already relative case) form <i>kia</i>."" The special variants of <i>pikau</i> are used in Golovin and Nunivak, and the Golovin form is similar to Inupiaq forms.

The cognate of <i>qavcik</i>, which means ‘wolverine’, is found in all Eskimo languages north of Yup’ik, while cognates of <i>terikaniaq</i>, which means ‘arctic fox’, is found in North Alaskan, Canadian and Greenlandic Inupiaq or Inuit. It is worthy to note that the Yup’ik for ‘marten’ is <i>qavcicuaq</i>, the literal meaning of which is ‘small wolverine’.

This particular map shows the Siamese-Chinese languages in what was then India and Burma.
<p>
On LSI maps of language families, such as this one, it is not always clear or consistent whether names refer to <i>languages</i> or <i>subgroups</i>. In our digitized versions, we have included the maximal language coding possible (i.e. if a name could refer to either a language or a subgroup, we include codes for both).
<p>
Note for reading these maps: The original LSI maps do not indicate boundaries or areas for all languages/dialects. This is why some language/dialect names appear simply as labels, while others appear as areas. That is, these two categories of labels are not meaningfully different (i.e. they do not represent different subgroups or anything similar) unless the legend specifically indicates otherwise.",,,,54e4e0b75c6e8bf944872e15cd26a28f

The first pattern is used by older speakers and the second younger speakers reported by the four villages in the Bethel area.

Please note that rivers and villages are part of this map, but have been turned off in the default view to avoid clutter; if you would like to view them, click the appropriate boxes in the legend.
<p>
Several important features of this map require some explanation:
- The apportionment of land to different dialects is not especially meaningful; the purpose of the map is to show which villages are in which areas. For instance, the Norton Sound Kotlik subdialect consists only of the village of Kotlik; the two-dimensional area it encompasses is presumably for graphical convenience.
- The ""transitional zones"" indicate regions in which speakers cannot be definitively classified into either of the adjacent dialects.
- The ""special areas"" are not dialects, but they are linguistically significant groupings, in which ""a number of lexical (and to a lesser extent, phonological) features cut across dialect and subdialect boundaries.""
- On the original map, Jacobson divides the Kuskokwim and Yukon rivers into lower, middle, and upper regions, with approximate boundaries. These do not represent linguistically differentiated areas, but are useful for making geographic reference to certain places throughout the Atlas. These boundaries have been left off this map for the sake of space, but you may view them by clicking the original image link.
<p>
Finally, Jacobson also points out that his dialect areas correspond very little to maps of Yup'ik ""tribes"" produced by other scholars (and generally calls into question the validity of the concept of ""tribes"" with respect to the Yup'ik).",,,,f0b0ae4eec4f541f63db9d07b69ca2dd

For the Yup’ik item—<i>Walrus</i>—Jacobson notes that <i>kaugpak</i> is an alternative to the pan-Eskimo term <i>asveq</i> and also a central coast innovation based on an obsolete word <i>*kauk</i>--a cognate to the Inupiaq word for ‘edible walrus skin’. <i>Kaugpak</i> was spread by Nunivak walrus hunters coming up to the Kuskokwim selling walrus. <i>Qecigpak</i> in Egegik and Lake Iliamna has the same derivation to <i>kaugpak</i> because <i>qecik</i> means ‘skin,hide’.

Outside of Yup’ik, <i>amitatuk</i> is found in Alutiiq, Naukanki and Sirenikski, and within Yup’ik it is used in Egegik, Hooper Bay- Chevak and the Yukon delta. <i>Teriaq</i> has Inupiaq cognates and is reported from very few sporadic Yup’ik places and never as the only word for ‘weasel’.

For the Yup’ik item—<i>Weather, world, awareness</i>—Jacobson suggests that <i>cilla</i> could be the original form as still in Hooper Bay- Chevak and Egegik (and as supported by the <i>i</i>  in the Naukanski form and by the “strong” <i>i</i>  in the Inupiaq form). From <i>i</i>  to <i>e</i> reduction has happened in Siberian Yup’ik, most Yup’ik, and Alutiiq.  Words beginning originally with <i>ci</i>  followed by an apical are in a similar situation, such as <i>sitaman/ cetaman</i>  ‘four’ and <i>cińa/ceńa</i>  ‘shore’. The deletion of initial <i>c</i>  preceding <i>ell</i>  represents the core GCY phenomenon that has spread to Nunivak and Alutiiq. Other similar cases to <i>cilla</i> becoming <i>cella</i> which becomes <i>ella</i> in the area are: <i>cilli-/celli-/elli-</i> ‘to whet’, and <i>cilleg-/ celleg-/ elleg-</i> ‘to be thick around, to be stout’.

While the respective points may be the same in size, this does not reflect the population density: some villages can have less than fifty speakers while others have populations up to a thousand. 
Please note: The letters correspond to the map's original image. Thus, in this map, A stands for <i>1st contemporative mood not used</i>, B stands for <i>tangellrania</i>, and C stands for <i>tangellranga</i>.  
For the Yup’ik item—<i>When he saw me</i>—Jacobson notes that <i>1st contemporative mood</i> ‘when one –ed’ is an Yup'ik innovation and only found in Yup’ik. Derived from the localis due to its localis ending <i>ni</i> on intransitive forms such as <i>qavallem<u>ni</u></i> ‘when I slept’ (compare <i>quavarpailegma</i> ‘before I slept’), <i>ni</i> is also found between the subject and object markers of transitive forms with a 4th person subject such as <i>tangllermi<u>ni</u>a</i> ‘when he (subject) saw me’. As the map indicates, <i>ni</i> in transitive forms with a 3rd or 2nd person singular subject is used primarily in the central coastal region. Areas using <i>tangellra<u>ni</u>a</i> instead of <i>tangellranga</i> also says <i>tangllerpe<u>ni</u>u</i> instead of <i>tangllerpegu</i> as elsewhere for ‘when you saw him’. Finally, the author points out that the same remnant of localis is used with the 2nd contemporative mood (‘while one –s’). Therefore, <i>tangva(gng)inanra<u>ni</u>q</i> and <i>tangva(gng)inanerpe<u>ni</u>u</i> are used instead of <i>tangva(gng)inanranga</i> and <i>tangva(gng)inanerpegu</i> for ‘while he was watching me’ and ‘while you were watching him’.

Of other Yup’ik words, <i>akakiik</i> may be from <i>akag-</i> ‘to roll’, <i>naptaq</i> literally means ‘one that is caught, as in a net’, and <i>qanerkicaq</i> is from ‘mouth’.

Jacobson points out that neither of these two post-contact bases is borrowed from Russian. The distribution of the usage of the bases for ‘writing’ is similar to that for HORSE and STOVE, which is a typical north vs. south pattern. In contrast, however, both HORSE and STOVE are Russian loan words.

Please note: The letters correspond to the map's original image. Thus, in this map, A stands for <i>kiugia</i> while B stands for <i>kiunga</i>. 
Jacobson notes that there are two forms of ‘you to me’ optative ending with verb bases which end in two vowels. For instance, the verb base for <i>kiu</i>- (‘to answer’) ends with two vowels. The two forms for the optative <i>kiu</i>- are: <i>kiugia</i> and <i>kiunga</i>. Jacobson also points out that both the two forms are used in most areas. However, only the usage of <i>Kiunga</i> is found in the following areas: most of the greater Bristol Bay area, the upper Kuskokwim and upriver Yukon, and most parts of the divergent dialects. Thus, according to Jacobson, <i>kiunga</i> is the original form from which <i>kiugia</i> derives.

In addition to <i>nakleng</i>, <i>akleng</i> is also used around the mouth of the Kuskokwim area with the meaning ‘so sorry’ rather than ‘poor thing.’ The author points out that two forms started as phonological variants has obtained a semantic difference.

An isolated language, Nafaanra, is also spoken in the west of Ghana. The Senufo languages are generally considered a branch of the Gur sub-family of Niger–Congo languages. Garber (1987) estimates the total number of Senufos at some 1.5 million; the Ethnologue, based on various population estimates, counts 2.7 million.

Regarding the question of <i>y</i> vs. <i>s</i>, surprisingly Nelson Is uses <i>ivsuk</i> instead of <i>ivyuk</i> which is very unusual for this area. So the author speculates that <i>ivsuk</i> is “a back formation from the verb <i>ivsir-</i> ‘to rain’ where the <i>i</i> would govern the choice of <i>y</i> or <i>s</i>”.  He also points out that cognates of <i>ivyuk/ivsuk</i> is unusual in other Eskimo languages too. One can see WEATHER to address the question of initial <i>c</i> in <i>cellalluk/ellalluk</i>.

For the Yup’ik item—<i>Eyelash</i>- Jacobson notes that the variation of <i>s</i> and <i>y</i> is predictable. Based on <i>qelm-</i> ‘to close one’s eyes,’ qelemyaq is a middle-upper Kuskokwim and upriver Yukon localism. <i>qelemyaq</i> is seen as <i>qelemsaq</i> in Golovin, which may be “an accidental case of convergence,” according to Jacobson.

According to the author, <i>e</i> is deleted in peripheral GCY; “the preceding vowel gets the stress that <i>e</i> would have had, and rhythmic stress assignment proceeds from there”. Also, <i>e</i> is deleted in core GCY, “and the word is re-evaluated for rhythmic stress just as if the <i>e</i> had never been there” which is the most extreme pattern according to Jacobson.

Therefore, one says <i>enka</i> ‘my house’, <i>enliut</i> ‘they are making a house’, <i>emra</i> ‘its water’ or homophonously ‘drink’, <i>emliraa</i> ‘he diluted it’, etc.  According to the author, in Hooper Bay- Chevak, Scammon Bay, and Egegik the initial <i>e</i> in <i>ena</i> is not weak except [e]meq. Therefore, one pronounces <i>enka</i>, <i>enliut</i>, <i>mer’a</i>, and <i>mel’iraa</i> for the same items. The initial <i>e</i> is weak in both <i>[e]na</i> and <i>[e]meq</i> in the rest of Yup’ik, so one says <i>nek’a</i>, <i>neliut</i>, <i>mer’a</i>, and <i>mel’iraa</i> for the same items.

While the respective points may be the same in size, this does not reflect the population density: some villages can have less than fifty speakers while others have populations up to a thousand.

For the Yup’ik item—<i>Sourdock, wild spinach</i>—Jacobson notes that cognates of the most common Yup’ik term—<i>quagciq</i>--are found in Siberian Yup’ik and Naukanski Yup’ik but for a different plant. Both <i>aatunaq</i> in Hooper Bay- Chevak and Koniaq Alutiiq and <i>civassaq</i> in Nunivak and Egegik support the Aglurmiut hypothesis. The author also comments the occurrence of <i>quunarliq</i> in Kotlik and upper Kuskokwim surprising. Also, it appears in Levelock and Chugach Alutiiq which makes the author speculates that this may be ""the case of convergence as <i>quunarliq</i> literally means ‘sour thing’"".

For the Yup’ik item—<i>Squirrel & marmot</i>—Jacobson notes that <i>cikik</i> is  only used by Norton Sound for ‘squirrel’ and <i>qanganaq</i> by the rest of Yup’ik (as in Alutiiq to the south). Also, a big part of Yup'ik uses <i>cikigpak</i> (literally ‘big <i>cikik</i>’) for ‘marmot’. <i>Uiq</i> (the second word for marmot) appears scarcely in the lower Kuskokwim and Bristol Bay and could be the cognate to <i>qusXiq</i> or <i>quiXiq</i> ‘marmot’ in Alutiiq. The author argues that marmots are uncommon in many places, so they have no word for this. Finally, he points out that <i>qavcik</i> WOLVERINE and <i>qavcicuaq</i> (literally ‘small <i>quavcik</i>’) is a similar situation to <i>cikik</i> and <i>cikigpak</i>.
